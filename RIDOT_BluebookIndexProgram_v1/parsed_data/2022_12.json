The Engineer will determine which trial mixture will be used for the mix design procedure.  \u2022  After a new mix design is completed, provide to the Engineer for review and approval.  \u2022  The Engineer will provide the correction factors for each mix for each ignition furnace in  the plant lab.  Provide the two gyratory cores (AASHTO T 312) and the theoretical maximum specific gravity sample (AASHTO T 209) at the optimum binder content to the Engineer.  Before beginning production of a new HMA mix, perform a successful plant trial batch for that mix. The Engineer will test a split of the sample taken by the Contractor.  Provide notification of the date and time of the trial batch to the Engineer 24 hours in advance.  If there is a change in sources of materials, establish a new mix design before the new material is used.  When the Engineer determines that unsatisfactory results or other conditions make it necessary, establish a new mix design and provide it to the Engineer for approval.  Quality Assurance.  a.  Process  Control.    Exercise  process  control  over  all  production  operations.    Provide constant monitoring of equipment, materials, and production activity such as testing and analysis to ensure that the HMA meets all applicable requirements and is produced within the allowable tolerances.  b.  Acceptance Testing.  The Engineer will conduct acceptance testing.  Take samples at the direction and in the presence of the Engineer according to AASHTO T 168.  The Engineer will take immediate possession of the samples.  Samples not provided to the Engineer immediately  will  not  be  used  for  acceptance.    Use  personnel  certified  by  NETTCP (Northeast  Transportation  Training  and  Certification  Program)  as  an  HMA  Plant Technician and subject to RIDOT Independent Assurance sampling and testing.  1.  Gradation,  Binder  Content,  and  Air  Void  Content.    Perform  gradations  according  to AASHTO T 30.  The requirements in the Table below apply to mixes with and without pay adjustments.  During production of a specific mix, if two consecutive tests do not meet the gradation requirements of the above Table or if one test exceeds double the tolerance on the control sieve, cease production of that HMA mix.  The Engineer will allow production to resume after the Contractor completes a successful trial batch for that class of mix. Acceptance sampling will resume with the subsequent sublot or as determined by the Engineer.

Do not sample trial batches until acceptance testing is complete.  The Engineer will allow production to resume after the Contractor completes a successful trial batch for that class of mix.  2.  Mix Production \u2014 Lots and Sublots.  A standard sublot is 600 tons for HMA sampled at  the  plant  for  each  production  run.    A  standard  lot  for  each  mix  is  10  sublots.    A sample will be randomly selected and tested for each sublot.  At least five sublots will be used when calculating pay adjustments.  If the quantity of HMA needed to finish a production run is projected by the Contractor to be less than the standard sublot size of 600 tons, the projected tonnage may be used to select a random sample.  If the projected tonnage is not produced or a random sample is unable to be taken, the Engineer may select a sample at the end of the run or at the paver.  If no sample is taken, the tonnage will be added to the previous sublot.  Additional samples may be taken at the discretion of the Engineer.  Gyratory  cores  and  theoretical  maximum  density  samples  will  be  retained  by  the Engineer for two weeks after the results are reported to the Contractor.  400-4  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS         Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  3.  Adjustments  to  Lots.    If  less  than  five  sublots  are  tested  after  the  end  of  the  final standard lot, they will be added to that lot.  Five or more sublots tested after the end of the final standard lot will constitute a separate lot.  4.  Plant Pay Adjustments.  If a class of HMA is designated with pay adjustments, the pay adjustments  for  deviation  from  the  optimum  binder  content  (established  by  the  mix design)  in the  Table  below  and  the design  air void  content  in  the  second  Table  will apply.

Note:  All  deviation  values  will  be  rounded  to  the  nearest  0.1  percent  before  applying  pay  adjustments.  5.  Calculation of Pay Adjustments for Production Binder and Air Void Content.  For each test,  absolute  deviations  will  be  used  when  determining  binder  and  air  void  content pay adjustments.  Absolute deviations are the values of deviation regardless of sign (\u00b1).  The average of the absolute deviations from the optimum binder content of all sublots in each lot will be used to determine the appropriate pay adjustments for the lots.    The  same  will  apply  for  air  void  content.    No  payment  will  be  made  for  any pavement that is removed.  6.  Independent Assurance Testing.  The Department will perform this testing according to  the  RIDOT  publication,  \u201cSchedule  for  Sampling,  Testing,  and  Certification  of Materials.\u201d  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  400-5       Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  401.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  HMA Mixing Plant.  Ensure that the HMA plant complies with AASHTO M 156.  Hauling Equipment.  Ensure  that  trucks  or  other  equipment  used  for  hauling  HMA  have  tight,  clean,  smooth,  metal beds, which have been thinly coated with an approved release agent.  Do not apply diesel fuel or other material to any portion of the vehicle that contacts the HMA.  For each truck, provide a solid cover of canvas or other suitable material that protects the mixture from the weather.  Load tri-axle trucks using a minimum of two drops, front and back.  Load trailers using a minimum of three drops with the center drop always occurring last.  Do not clean equipment (vehicles, truck beds, etc.) in areas  to  be  paved.  A  material  transfer  vehicle  (MTV)  is  required  for  the  construction  of  all  HMA  friction,  surface, intermediate, and base courses on all limited access highways listed in the Table below.  Use the MTV on travel lanes, auxiliary lanes, climbing lanes, acceleration and deceleration lanes, ramps, collector/distributor roads, service roads, and shoulder widths greater than 8 ft.  Adjust the speed of the paver and MTV to coordinate with the availability of HMA.  Failure to keep the MTV supplied with HMA may be cause to cease paving operations.  Ensure  that  the  MTV  independently  delivers  HMA  from  the  hauling  equipment  to  the  paving equipment.  Install a paving hopper insert with a minimum capacity of 14 tons in the hopper of conventional paving equipment when a MTV is used.  As a minimum, use a MTV that has a high capacity truck unloading system that will receive HMA from the hauling equipment, a storage system in the MTV with a minimum capacity of 15 tons of HMA, and a discharge conveyor that can swivel to either side to deliver the mixture to the paver while  allowing  the  MTV  to  operate  from  an  adjacent  lane.    In  addition,  ensure  that  the  paving operation contains a remixing system to blend the mixture before placement.  Adjust the speed of the paver and MTV to coordinate with the availability of HMA.  Failure to keep the MTV supplied with HMA may be cause to cease paving operations for this work.  In addition, the Engineer will suspend paving operations if more than two stoppages occur.  When a MTV will be used on a Project, investigate the possible movement of the fully or partially loaded MTV on the Project.  If there are any structures that the fully or partially loaded MTV will traverse,  request  an  Overweight  Permit  Check  from  the  Department.    Provide  a  copy  of  the request in writing to the Engineer, and include the axle configuration, weights, and the Project limits.  Do not restart operations until permission is received from the Engineer.  The following Table is a list of roadways requiring the use of a MTV.  400-6  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS        Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Limits  Connecticut State Line to Massachusetts State Line I-95 to Massachusetts State Line  I-95 to Massachusetts State Line Prosser Trail to Wakefield Cut-Off Route 1 to I-95 Route 102 to Route 101; Route 10 to I-295 Park Avenue to Route 6 Magnolia Street Bridge to I-95  Route 114 to Massachusetts State Line Natick Avenue to Post Road Route 1 to Connecticut State Line Route 146 to Mendon Road I-195 to Wampanoag Trail East Shore Expressway to Forbes Street  Route 1 to Admiral Kalbfus Road I-95 to Reservoir Road Route 146A to Massachusetts State Line Route 4 to Quonset Point I-95 to Post Road  Waterman Street/So.

Spread mixtures using a self-powered paver capable of spreading to line, grade, and crown.  Use auger extensions when the end of the screed extension is more than 2 ft from the end of the augers.  Ensure that the screed and screed extenders continually vibrate while placing the mixture.  Ensure that the screed is heated to maintain the HMA at the required placement temperature.  Ensure that the paver has been equipped with automatic screed controls with sensors for both sides of the paver, capable of sensing grade from an outside reference line, sensing the trans- verse slope of the screed and providing the automatic signals that operate the screed to maintain the  desired  grade  and transverse  slope.   Ensure  that  the sensors  can  operate  from  a ski-type device or reference beam of not less than 25 ft in length.  Ensure that the sensors can operate from a reference line, unless the ski-type device or reference beam can ride on an adjacent, newly placed lift of HMA.  Provide  reference  lines  for  the  control  of  horizontal  alignment,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the Engineer.  Ensure that the transverse slope controller can maintain the screed at the desired slope within \u00b10.1 percent.  Ensure that the paver is equipped with automatic feeder controls, properly adjusted to maintain a uniform depth of materials ahead of the screed.  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  400-7        Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Manual operation will be permitted in the construction of irregularly shaped and minor areas or where otherwise allowed by the Engineer.  Conditioning of Existing Surfaces.  Remove  all  striping  on  existing  surfaces  before  applying  the  tack  coat.    Provide  a  thin,  even coating of tack to surfaces of curbs, gutters, vertical faces of existing pavements, and all structures that will contact the HMA.  Avoid the splattering of surfaces that will not contact the HMA.  When a tack coat is required, provide a type and grade and application method that conforms to SECTION M03 and SECTION 403.  Spreading and Finishing.  Lay  the  mixture  on  an  approved  clean  surface,  which  has  been  spread  and  struck  off  to  the established grade and elevation.  Use HMA pavers to distribute the mixture either over the entire width or over a partial width approved by the Engineer.  Ensure that transverse joints are clean, smooth, uniform, vertical, and constructed using a fixed depth road saw.  Ensure  that  the  practices  and  guidelines  for  placing  HMA  comply  with  the  Asphalt  Institute Publication MS-22, \u201cConstruction of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements.\u201d  Do not allow unnecessary walking on the uncompacted HMA mat.  Before beginning a new lane, heat the screed to the proper operating temperature and remove any clumps of cold material in the paver hopper.  Do not allow trucks or other equipment on freshly placed HMA, unless permitted by the Engineer.  Where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impractical, place the mixture as close to its final position as possible.  Spread, rake, and lute with hand tools to minimize segregation and provide the required compacted thickness.  Protect catch basins to prevent HMA from entering the basin and to enable the grate to be easily removed after paving.  If paving results in HMA entering the catch basin or in bonding the grate to the frame preventing its normal removal, remove all HMA from the catch basin and clean the grate to debond the two.  If unforeseen circumstances cause the paving operation to cease, provide a minimum of three loaded trucks on site before paving will be allowed to resume.  Compaction.  Immediately  after  the  HMA  has  been  spread,  struck  off,  and  surface  irregularities  adjusted, uniformly compact by rolling.  Roll  the  surface  when  the  mixture  is  in  the  proper  condition  and  when  rolling  does  not  cause undue displacement, cracking, and shoving.  Compact HMA used on bridge decks with an oscillatory roller.  400-8  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS        Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Compact HMA used as leveling course with a pneumatic roller.  Use two rollers for all paving operations that exceed a daily total of 500 tons, except for driveway, sidewalk,  and  bridge  deck  paving  operations.    Provide  a  number,  weight,  and  type  of  roller(s) sufficient  to  compact  the  mixture  to  the  required  density  before  it  reaches  the  minimum compaction temperature.  Use rollers in the vibratory mode.  Provide rollers used for compaction with  a  minimum  operating  weight  of  10  tons  or  greater.    Do  not  use  equipment  that  results  in excessive crushing of the aggregate.  Ensure that the speed of a roller does not exceed 5 mph.  Do not park rollers on HMA.  Only stop rollers on HMA when reversing direction.  When reversing direction, ensure that the action is smooth, not abrupt.  Ensure that the drive wheel approaches the new mix, not the tiller wheel.  When a vibratory roller is used for finish rolling, use the roller in the static mode.  Continue finishing rolling until all roller marks are eliminated.  Do not allow traffic on newly placed pavement until the temperature falls below 130 degrees F.  Ensure that the motion of the rollers is sufficiently slow to avoid displacement of the hot mixture. Ensure that the wheels of steel-wheel rollers remain moist and clean to prevent adhesion of the fresh material; however, do not apply an excess of water.  If  satisfactory  density  cannot  be  obtained  in  any  lift,  and  if  the  Engineer  determines  that  it  is structurally inadequate and/or incapable of maintaining material integrity, remove and replace the area(s) at no additional cost to the Department.  Remove and replace any mixture that becomes loose and broken, mixed with dirt, or is otherwise defective and place fresh hot mixture, which must be compacted to conform to the surrounding area.  Remove and replace any area demonstrating an excess or deficiency of PGAB.  a.  In-Place Density for Classes of HMA not Designated as \u201cwith Pay Adjustments.\u201d  For HMA not designated with Pay Adjustments, ensure that the in-place density is a minimum of 92 percent of the theoretical maximum density obtained at the plant.  If a class of HMA is designated for bridge decks, use an oscillatory roller with a minimum operational  weight  of  8  tons.    For  HMA  designated  for  bridge  decks  and  with  Pay Adjustments, the pay adjustments will only apply to binder content and air voids.  In-place density will not be used for acceptance testing.  If a class of HMA is designated for leveling, place the HMA with a paver.  Use a pneumatic roller with a minimum operational weight of 8 tons.  In-place density will not be used for acceptance testing.  For HMA designated for leveling and with Pay Adjustments, the pay adjustments will apply only to binder content and air voids.  If a class of HMA is designated for patching, miscellaneous work, or paved waterways, place the HMA by hand.  Use a vibratory plate compactor or roller.  A hand tamper may be used only if approved by the Engineer.  In-place density will not be used for acceptance testing.  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  400-9     Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  b.  In-Place Density for Classes of HMA designated as \u201cwith Pay Adjustments.\u201d  Compaction density  will  be  measured  using  cores  of  in-place  pavement  extracted  according  to AASHTO R 67.  Extract cores under the direction of and witnessed by the Engineer. Otherwise, the cores will not be used for acceptance.  The Engineer will determine the location of all cores.  Each lot and sublot for in-place density cores will be matched as near as practical to each production lot and sublot used at the plant.  Extract  all  cores  after  completion  of  rolling  operations  and  before  the  paved  section  is open to traffic.  The Engineer will take immediate possession of the cores upon extraction. If the Contractor does not obtain cores before a sublot is open to traffic, no bonus (pay adjustment resulting in more than 0 percent) will be paid for the sublot but disincentives will still apply.  Bulk specific gravities will be determined according to AASHTO T 166, regardless of whether  the  absorption  exceeds  2.0  percent.    The  Engineer  will  retain  the  cores  for four weeks after the results are reported to the Contractor.  For HMA designated as for bridge decks, cores will not be required or allowed.  The  Contractor  may  extract  its  own  cores  for  QC  to  monitor  in-place  density  and production quality; however, these cores will not be used for acceptance.  1.  Mat Density.  A standard sublot is 600 tons.  A non-standard sublot is the quantity of HMA placed if there is less than 600 tons produced after the final standard sublot.  Under the direction of and witness by  the Engineer, extract  two stratified, randomly selected cores (diameters between 3.75 in. and 4 in.) from the mat for each standard sublot.  One  core  is  taken  for  sublots  less  than  450  tons.  The Table below will be used to determine the minimum number of cores extracted from the mat.  The  center of  each  core  used  to determine mat density will be at least 1 ft away from the edge of pavement, transverse or longitudinal joints, or drainage structures.

Ensure that cores taken from butt joints are 6 in. in diameter.  3.  In-Place Density Pay Adjustments.  In-place density will be measured and reported as a percent of theoretical maximum density.  The pay adjustments from the Table below will be made for in-place mat density.  MAT Density Pay Adjustments  In-Place Mat Density  95.0% and greater  94.0% to 94.9%  93.0% to 93.9%  92.0% to 92.9%  91.0% to 91.9%  90.0% to 90.9%  89.0% to 89.9%  Below 89.0%  Pay Adjustment  +2%  +1%  0%  -5%  -15%  -25%  -35%  Remove and Replace  The pay adjustments from the Table below will be made for in-place joint density.

Calculation of Pay Adjustments for In-Place Density.  \u2022  Mat Density.  For each sublot, the bulk specific gravity (Gmb) of the mat density core(s) will be averaged and then compared to the corresponding plant theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) to calculate the in-place density for each sublot.  The average of the sublot densities in a lot will be used to determine the appropriate pay adjustment for that lot.  Lot pay adjustments will be applied to the respective quantity of HMA in each lot.  \u2022  Joint Density.  For joint density pay adjustments, a joint lot will be defined as 10 joint density results.  However, if less than five joint density results are remaining after the final full joint lot is formed, they will be added to the previous joint lot.  Five or more joint density results remaining after the final full joint lot will constitute a separate joint  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  400-11        Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  lot.  A minimum of five joint density cores will be used to calculate pay adjustments.  If five cores are not available, the joint density pay adjustments will not be used.  Calculation of in-place joint density will be determined using the Gmb of joint density cores and the project average plant Gmm of the respective mix.  The average of the individual joint density results in a joint lot will be used to determine the appropriate pay adjustment for that joint lot.  The calculation of material quantity used to construct the joints will be based on the joint core density, the specified thickness, a width of one ft and the total length of the joints on the Project.  This quantity will be deducted from the total tonnage.  Joints.  Ensure that the placement of the HMA is as continuous as possible.  Do not allow rollers to pass over the unprotected end of a freshly laid mixture, unless authorized by the Engineer.  Stagger both longitudinal and transverse joints in successive courses so that neither is above the other.    Stagger  longitudinal  and  transverse  joints  a  minimum  of  6  in.,  and  arrange  so  that  the longitudinal joint in the top course is at the location of the line dividing the traffic lanes.  Rake any HMA that falls on the cold side of the mat onto the hot side during paving operations.  Ensure that the material pushed onto the hot side of the joint remains in the joint area and is not broadcast over the pavement.  Use a notched wedge joint maker on all drop-offs, regardless of whether they are on the left, right, or both sides of the pavement.  Construct joints so that the height of the notch is the same as the nominal maximum aggregate size.  Provide a width of the sloped portion of the joint that is at least 6 in. for each inch of lift thickness if the joint will be exposed to traffic.  However, ensure that the width is 12 in. minimum.  Apply tack coat to the longitudinal notched wedge joint that covers the joint.  If a distribution truck is used, apply the tack coat at twice the specified rate.  Manually brush transverse joints and joints at intersections with tack coat, ensuring that the face is completely covered.  Pavement Samples.  As  directed,  cut  samples  from  the  compacted  pavement  for  testing  by  the  Engineer.    Extract samples of the mixture for the full depth of the course at the locations directed by the Engineer.  Where samples have been taken, place and compact new material to conform to the surrounding area.  Weather Limitations.  Do not place HMA on any wet surface or when weather conditions otherwise prevent the proper handling or finishing of the HMA.  For lifts with a target compacted lift thickness less than or equal to 1.5 in., only place HMA when both the air and surface temperature in the shade is 45\u00b0F or greater.  If an approved WMA (warm mix additive) is used, ensure that the temperatures are 40\u00b0F or greater.  For lifts with a target compacted  lift  thickness  greater  than  1.5  in.,  only  place  HMA  when  both  the  air  and  surface temperature in the shade is 40\u00b0F or greater.  Do not place HMA on frozen ground.  400-12  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS        Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Ensure  that  the  HMA  mat  is  at  least  265\u00b0F  when  placed.    If,  after  mobilization,  the  weather limitations have an impact, assume all costs associated with the stopping, delaying, or canceling of operations.  Cold-Weather Paving.  If the existing pavement is removed before the winter shutdown, do not close the Project for the season  until  a  new  HMA  layer  has  been  placed  and  striped  with  temporary  epoxy  pavement markings.  If paving cannot be performed because temperatures do not rise above 40oF, then the pavement will be designated as temporary.  Repave that segment of roadway in the spring when temperatures exceed 40oF.  Drop-Offs.  a. Longitudinal Drop-Offs.

A transverse drop-off occurs when pavement removal operations begin or end on a working day.  The drop-off is the difference in elevation between the bottom of the excavated pavement and the top of the existing pavement.  \u25cf Pavement Overlay.  A transverse drop-off occurs when pavement overlay operations begin or end on a working day.  The drop-off is the difference in elevation between the top of the overlay pavement and the top of the underlying pavement.  Construct drop- offs using a bond breaking material between the drop-off and the underlying pavement.  If  traffic  is  allowed  across  any  transverse drop-off  before  the  resumption  of pavement removal or pavement overlay operations, provide tapers as follows:  \u25cf Construct all slopes with HMA conforming to the requirements of  SECTION 401.  \u25cf Place  BUMP  signs  according  to  the  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices  for  each drop-off for each direction of traffic.  \u25cf Before the resumption of pavement overlay operations, remove the transition slope as follows:  Saw cut the pavement overlay back approximately 6 in. to expose a fresh, full thickness vertical face.  Brush paint or pressure spray this face with tack coat, after which the HMA paving may resume.  The sawcut work will be considered incidental to pavement operations.  401.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Measurement of HMA Pavement.  HMA pavements will be measured by the number of tons placed.  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  400-13  Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  a. Determination of Thickness.  Before the determination of the in-place thickness, ensure that  the  roadway  exhibits  acceptable  workmanship  and  that  all  defects  have  been corrected.  The placed thickness of HMA pavement will be determined by cutting or coring holes.    For  courses  with  in-place  density  cores  specified,  the  average  thickness  of  the density  cores  will  be  used  to  determine  the  in-place  thickness.    For  courses  placed  on bridge decks, bike paths, or sidewalks, neither final nor density cores will be required.  Cores will be measured according to ASTM D3549, \u201cStandard Test Method for Thickness or Height of Compacted HMA Paving Mixture Specimens.\u201d  The depth measurement will apply to the full width of the lane.  Measurements will be made at random locations as determined by the Engineer.  For the determination of thickness, a shoulder width of 8 ft or greater will be considered to be a separate lane of the roadway.  A shoulder width of less than 8 ft will be considered part of the adjacent lane.  For cores taken by the Contractor, fill all holes with a compacted, dense HMA that is acceptable to the Engineer.  If required by the Engineer, maintain and control traffic while pavement samples are taken and while the holes are being filled and compacted.  b. Adjustment of Tonnage Quantity.  The pavement thickness will be considered acceptable  if both of the following requirements are met:  \u25cf The total HMA tonnage delivered and placed does not exceed the tonnage calculated from the approved area measured from the final surface course width by the Project length and the specified pavement thickness by more than 5 percent.  \u25cf When  \u201cSpecification  Conformity  Analysis,\u201d  FHWA  Technical  Advisory  T5080.12,\u201d dated  June  23,  1989,  is  applied  to  the  entire  roadway  or  sections  thereof  as determined by the Engineer, at least 80 percent of the total HMA pavement will have a thickness that meets the minimum pavement thickness.  The minimum pavement thickness is that contained in the Contract minus \u00bd in. (e.g., a total pavement thickness of 7 in. will have a minimum pavement thickness requirement of 6.5 in.).  If the first requirement is not met, no payment will be made for all tonnage exceeding 5 percent,  unless  unusual  field  conditions  are  present  and  documented  (e.g.,  pavement rutting).  If  the  second  requirement  indicates  that  the  pavement  thickness  is  deficient,  place  a correction course, with the permission of the Engineer, not less than 1 in. in depth after compaction,  provided  that  an  acceptable  grade  and  cross  section  can  be  achieved. Where  an  acceptable  grade  and  cross  section  cannot  be  achieved  through  the  above means, reconstruct by cutting back and into the pavement a sufficient distance to permit the  placement  of  an  acceptable  depth,  and  place  new  material  to  achieve  the  proper depth, cross section, and profile.  Where a corrective course is placed or reconstruction of the pavement is performed, these areas will be measured again as though originally constructed.    No  compensation  will  be  made  for  the  material  removed;  or  removal  of materials  and  disposal  thereof;  or  for  restoration  of  the  affected  supporting  base  or adjacent construction; or for traffic control; or for adjusting all utility appurtenances in the roadway;  or  for  correcting  pavement  striping.    Compensation  will  be  made  for  the additional pavement correction course accepted in place.  400-14  SECTION 401 \u2014 DENSE GRADED HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) PAVEMENTS  Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Determination of the quantity to be used for adjusted payment or exclusion for payment will  be  based  on  tons  per square  yard  per  inch thickness  as  determined  using  in-place density cores or 96 percent of the plant core (AASHTO T245) densities if in-place densities are not available.  If both in-place and plant core densities are not available, 94 percent of the plant theoretical maximum density results will be used.  Sweeping and cleaning, as included in the items covered by this Section, only refers to the normal removal of dust, debris, etc.  Work described in Subsection 401.03.4 will be paid for at the Contract unit prices for the material used.  c. Tolerance  Limitation.    Unless  e-ticketing  is  used,  when  delivery  tickets  are  directly collected by the Engineer from each truck before placing in the hopper, the delivery tickets will be used in the determination of total tonnage delivered and placed.  Payment will be made at the Contract unit bid prices with pay adjustments for all accepted HMA up to 105 percent of the Contract quantity tonnage.  Accepted HMA quantities above 105 percent and up to 110 percent of the Contract quantity tonnage will be paid at 50 percent of the Contract unit bid price and, with the resultant adjusted price, will be further modified by additional pay adjustments as applicable according to the following formula:  Pay adjustments will apply to 50 percent of the Contract unit bid price for quantities above 105 percent and up to 110 percent.  No payment will be made for quantities above 110 percent.  Measurement of HMA Preparation.  HMA preparation will be measured by SY.

See SECTION 415.  \u25cf When friction course is placed on bridge decks, use an oscillatory roller in oscillatory  mode.  402.03  CONSTRUCTION.  Placement.  Placement will be as in Subsection 401.03 with the following exceptions.  Produce the HMA at 300\u00b0F \u00b120\u00b0F.  Use a material transfer vehicle (MTV) for the placement of friction course and the underlying layer in all travel lanes.  Operate the MTV from an adjacent lane unless the Engineer approves its use in the same lane as the paver.  The use and operation of  a  MTV  may  be  waived  with  justification  as  approved  by  the  Engineer.    If  unforeseen circumstances cause the paving operation to cease, provide a minimum of three loaded trucks on site before paving will be allowed to resume.  After placement, uniformly compact the mixture with powered vibratory or oscillatory steel drum rollers.  If more than 500 tons of daily placement, operate a minimum of three rollers to handle the  output  of the  plant.   If  less than  500  tons,  operate  a minimum  of two  rollers  to  handle  the output  of  the  plant.    Operate  rollers  in  vibratory  mode  on  pavements  and  oscillatory  mode  on bridge decks.  Each  lane  may  be  paved  so that  a  longitudinal drop-off  remains  until  the  next  paving session. Proceed with each subsequent paving operation adjacent to the previous.  Use a 12-in. notched wedge joint maker on all drop-offs, regardless of whether they are on the left, right, or both sides of the pavement.  Spray notched wedge joints with tack coat at a rate of between 0.12 and 0.14 gal/sq yd.  Manually brush transverse joints with tack coat.  Ensure that transverse drop offs at the end of a paving session comply with Subsection 401.03.11.  Use RS-1 or RS-1h tack coat and uniformly apply at a rate of between 0.08 and 0.10 gal/sq yd to the underlying surface to be paved.  400-18  SECTION 402 \u2014 FRICTION COURSE  Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Weather Limitations.

The actual rate of application within these ranges requires that the cover aggregate be embedded at 50 percent of the stone particle size into the asphalt rubber binder with minimal stone loss following compaction.  Ensure that longitudinal joints are reasonably true to line and parallel to centerline.  Where any construction joint occurs, broom and blend the edges back so that there are no gaps, the elevations are the same, and the joints are free from ridges and depressions.  Overlap longitudinal joints from 4 in. to 6 in.  During application, prevent the adjacent pavements, curbing, structures, vehicles, foliage, and personal property from any marring or discoloration.  Limit each spray application to 3000 ft in length.  Place, roll, and sweep cover stone.  Then, drop back and square off the 3000-ft chip seal placement before proceeding.  b.  Cover Aggregate Application.  Ensure that the application of cover aggregate follows as close as possible behind the application of the rubberized asphalt.  Ensure that the asphalt is not applied any further in advance of the aggregate spreader than can be immediately covered.  Do not allow construction equipment or other vehicles to drive on the uncovered rubberized asphalt.  Spread the hot-precoated cover aggregate uniformly and completely across  the  hot  rubberized  asphalt  by  a  self-propelled  spreader  at  the  approved  design application rate within a tolerance of +5 lb/sq yd.  Ensure that the application rate is not less than 30 lb/sq yd.  Cover any deficient areas with additional cover material to provide total coverage.  c.  Rolling.  Initiate rolling with pneumatic tire rollers immediately following the spread of pre- coated aggregate.  Ensure that there are at least three passes of a roller to embed the cover aggregate particles firmly into the rubberized asphalt.  To attain coverage, use as many passes as necessary to cover the entire width being spread.  A pass is defined as one movement of a roller in either direction.  Ensure that the roller speed does not exceed 6 mph.  Do not allow any steel wheel rollers.  d.  Initial Sweeping.  When the maximum amount of aggregate has been embedded into the asphalt rubber binder and the pavement has cooled, sweep or otherwise remove all loose material.  Perform the removal to avoid the displacement of any embedded aggregate or any damage to the new surface.  Remove all loose cover material from the paved surface by sweeping when the chip sealed surface has cooled to below 120\u00b0F after application; however,  if  the  Engineer  determines  that  conditions  are  not  conducive  to  obtaining  the best results due to weather, temperature, or other reasons, discontinue sweeping until the Engineer has determined the best time for removal.  Collect the sweeping accumulations and dispose of properly off site.  SECTION 412 \u2014 RUBBERIZED ASPHALT CHIP SEALING  400-43     Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  e.  Site Clean Up.  Uncover and unseal all drainage openings and clean any covers or grates that the cover aggregate and rubberized asphalt may have adhered to and remove any excess material in areas such as driveways, gutters, and intersections as specified by the Engineer.  On a daily basis, remove any debris associated with the performance of the work.  f.  Protection of Surface.  Do not allow traffic on the chip sealed road surface until all rolling has been completed and the asphalt rubber binder has cooled and set as satisfactory to the Engineer.  Ensure that traffic does not exceed 25 mph by the use of a pilot car.  Use the  pilot  car  to  control  traffic  flow  at  all  points  during  chip  seal  work  operations.    Post \u201cLoose Stone\u201d signs at the beginning limit of the chip seal operation and at every one-mile interval.  Ensure that the speed limit and other required signing meets all Department and Contract requirements.  Ensure that the signs remain in place for a minimum of 24 hours after the chip seal has been placed.  Do not remove signing until the loose aggregate is removed  from  the  roadway  and  all  other  Contract  requirements  are  fulfilled  (e.g.,  line striping) so that the original posted speed limit can be reinstated.  The Contractor shall be responsible for any damage done to vehicles as a result of the operation.  g.  Post Placement Sweepings.  Conduct post placement sweepings at the following times:  \u25cf  Five to seven days after the rubberized asphalt chip sealing operation  \u25cf  Between October 15 and November 15 after the rubberized chip sealing operation  \u25cf  Starting April 1st at the end of the first winter after the rubberized asphalt chip sealing  operation  For  each  sweeping,  remove  all  loose  cover  aggregate  from  the  pavement  surface, including the shoulders.  Collect and properly dispose of the accumulations of sweepings off site.  412.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Rubberized Asphalt Chip Sealing will be measured by the number of square yards of rubberized asphalt chip seal placed.  Removal of pavement markings will be measured by the LF.  412.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.  The Department will pay for the completed and accepted quantities at the Contract unit price as follows.  Pay Item  Rubberized Asphalt Chip Sealing  Pay Unit  SY  The price constitutes full compensation for traffic control and pilot car; mobile cell phones; surface preparation;  furnishing,  transporting,  handling,  placing,  and  rolling  the  material  specified;  all  400-44  SECTION 412 \u2014 RUBBERIZED ASPHALT CHIP SEALING        Part 400 \u2013 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  sweeping  and  removal  of  excess  aggregate;  site  cleanup;  and  furnishing  all  labor,  tools, equipment, and incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted.  The shim course will be paid for under separate items in the Contract.  The cost of tack coat for shim course is incidental and not paid separately.  Removal of pavement markings is paid under Subsection T20.05.

This specification addresses pavement rideability as determined by the Engineer according to the rating scale, based upon post-paving rideability determination.  Standard roads are roadways with posted speed limits above 30 mph.  For roads with speed limits that  vary  based  on  time  of  day  (e.g.,  school  zones),  the  higher  speed  limit  applies  to  this specification.  Any reclaimed road will be evaluated as a 35-mph road or at its posted speed limit (whichever is greater) for rideability pay adjustments.  Low-speed roads are roads with a posted speed limit of 30 mph or below.  A  travel  lane  is  the  primary  traveled  portion  of  the  roadway  excluding  non-normally  traveled pavement surfaces.  Leave-out sections include:  \u2022  Roundabouts and bridge decks  \u2022  Areas 25 ft before and after pavement segments with catch basins in the travel lane and 15 ft before and after pavement segments with manholes or other structures in the travel lane  \u2022  Areas 25 ft before and after bridge joints  \u2022  Areas 25 ft after and before the Project paving limits  all as determined by the Engineer.  Additional areas may be excluded from testing in the interest of obtaining data safely.  413.02  MATERIALS.  N/A  413.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Pavement  rideability,  or  ride  quality,  will  be  determined  by  the  Engineer  using  a  profiler  on  all travel lanes.  The profiler will meet all equipment requirements of AASHTO M 328 and R 56.  Rideability for Standard Roads.  The  surface  course  ride  quality  acceptance  will  be  based  on  a)  the  average  International Roughness Index (IRI) from three tests using a profiler established for each wheel path for 528-ft (0.1 mile) standard fixed intervals, and b) a simulated 10-ft rolling straightedge analysis for the width  of  each  travel  lane  from  one  representative  test.    The  testing  will  be  conducted  by  the Engineer.  The selected tests will be chosen based on the data correlation between tests, profile lengths, and any factors noted during data collection or evidenced upon review to better qualify or disqualify a test.  The representative tests will be selected at the Engineer\u2019s discretion.  An  IRI  number  in  inches  per  mile  will  be  established  following  Department  procedures  using ProVAL  or  software  supplied  by  the  manufacturer  of  the  profiler  for  each  528-ft  (0.1-mile)  400-46  SECTION 413 \u2014 RIDEABILITY \u2013 SURFACE COURSE        Part 400 \u2013 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  longitudinal section for each wheel path in each travel lane.  A 300-ft long-wavelength (high-pass) filter  will  be  applied  during  testing.    A  250mm  short-wavelength  (moving  average)  filter  will  be applied during analysis using ProVAL or other aforementioned profiling software.  A sublot will be each single wheelpath for each 0.1-mile section of each travel lane.  Therefore, each 0.1-mile section of travel lane will consist of two sublots.  A standard lot is defined as 20 consecutive sublots.  If a road segment has less than 20 but more than six consecutive sublots for each wheelpath, a lot will be comprised of all sublots from one wheelpath.  If a road segment has six or fewer consecutive sublots for each wheelpath, a lot will be comprised of all sublots from the road segment.  If the final lots include 10 or more sublots for each wheelpath, they will be considered their own lots.  If the final lots are fewer than 10 sublots, they will be added to the preceding  or  adjacent  lots.   Lots may  be  combined  with  adjacent  lots  in the  following  order  of preference \u2015 with previous lot of the same wheelpath in the same lane, with opposite wheelpath of the same lane, with both wheelpaths of adjacent lane in the same direction or similar lane in the opposite direction within the same road segment, or as determined by the Engineer.  If the Project paving limits for one roadway segment including all lanes consist of fewer than 0.46 lane- miles, the roadway segment paved will be considered a pavement patch (Subsection 413.03.2).  Leave-out sections are excluded from rideability analysis for pay adjustments.  All areas included in the paving limits (including leave-out sections) will be tested using a 10-ft rolling straightedge simulation analysis using ProVAL or other profiling software.  The variation of the surface between any two contacts along the simulated straightedge shall not be more than 0.25 in., except for manholes, catch basins, and other structures in the travel lane, which shall not deviate from the surface by more than 0.30 in. below final grade or 0.10 in. above final grade of  pavement  as  tested  with  a  10-ft  straightedge  or  rolling  straightedge  simulation.    Humps, depressions, and utility structures (as adjusted or remaining) exceeding the specified tolerances shall be subject to correction.  Provide the corrective work plan including method of correction to the  Engineer  for  approval.    Do  not  perform  any  corrective  work  without  the  approval  of  the Engineer.  Sections before leave-out sections and the section at the end of the paving limit will be added to the previous sublot or subsequent section(s) if they are less than 0.05 miles or may be considered a full sublot if they are greater than or equal to 0.05 miles.  For roadways with numerous utility structures, with successive sections before or between leave-out sections, or at the end of the paving  limit  that  are  less  than  or  near  to  0.05  miles,  the  sections  will  be  combined  to  best approximate 0.10 miles for each sublot.  No sublot will exceed 0.15 miles.  Rideability for Low-Speed Roads and Pavement Patches.  The Department will measure from 10 ft before to 10 ft after the paving limits of low-speed roads or  permanent  pavement  patches  in  the  lane  and  test  this  road  segment  using  a  10-ft  rolling straightedge  simulation  analysis  in  ProVAL  or  other  profiling  software.    If  the  variation  of  the surface  between  any  two  contacts  along  the  simulated  straightedge  exceeds  0.25  in.  at  any distance from 2 ft before to 2 ft after the paving limits or pavement patch, provide a corrective work  plan,  and  perform  the  corrective  action.    Do  not  perform  any  corrective  work  without  the approval of the Engineer.  In addition, the -0.30-in. to +0.10 in. surface deviation tolerances noted in Subsection 413.03.1 will apply for any manholes or other structures in the lane that are within the paving limits of the low-speed road or pavement patch.  SECTION 413 \u2014 RIDEABILITY \u2013 SURFACE COURSE  400-47     Part 400 \u2014 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  Ensure that permanent pavement patches and structures, including any corrective work, continue to comply with the tolerances described above for the longer of one year after installation or one year  after  completion  of  any  required  corrective  work,  or  additional  corrective  work  will  be required.  Rideability for Bridges.  The  Department  will  measure  the  entire  length  of  each  bridge  section  using  a  10-ft  rolling straightedge simulation analysis in ProVAL or other profiling software.  The bridge section a) starts 10  ft  before  the  initial  bridge  pavement  cut  and  match  or  25  ft  before  the  initial  bridge  joint, whichever is farther, and b) stops 10 ft beyond the terminal bridge pavement cut and match or 25 ft beyond the terminal bridge joint, whichever is farther.  The bridge section includes the approach pavement, entry approach slab, bridge deck, exit approach slab, and exit pavement.  If only the bridge  deck  is  paved  (no  approaches),  the  section  of  new  pavement  will  be  considered  a pavement patch.  Perform corrective work when the variation of the surface between any two contacts along the simulated straightedge exceeds 0.25 in. in any profile within the full width of a marked traffic lane along the measured length of the bridge section.  Provide a corrective work plan to the Engineer for  approval  before  performing  corrective  work.    This  plan  may  include  mill  and  overlay,  PCC overlay, diamond grinding, or a combination thereof.  Any costs associated with structural review of added loads to the bridge will be tracked by the Department and reimbursed by the Contractor as a disincentive using a Report of Change.  To produce a uniform cross section, the Engineer may require corrections to the adjoining lanes and shoulders.  Do not perform any corrective work without the approval of the Engineer.  413.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  The Table below provides the pay adjustment and corrective action criteria for standard roads based upon the posted speed limit of the roadway and the IRI of each sublot.  IRI values will be rounded to the nearest integer value for each sublot before assessing the pay adjustment.  When corrections to the pavement surface are required, provide the corrective work plan including method  of  correction  to  the  Engineer  for  approval.    Limit  the  method  of  correction  to  diamond grinding,  flat  tooth  grinding  or  removing,  and  replacing  the  affected  pavement.    If  grinding  is selected, provide a grinding simulation using ProVAL to the Engineer for approval.  To produce a uniform cross section, the Engineer may require corrections to the adjoining lanes and shoulders. Corrections will be at no additional cost to the Department.  Do not perform any corrective work without the approval of the Engineer.  Where corrections are made after the official Department test, the pavement will be retested by the Engineer to verify that corrections have produced an acceptable ride surface.  No incentives will be provided for sections on which corrective actions are performed.  400-48  SECTION 413 \u2014 RIDEABILITY \u2013 SURFACE COURSE        Part 400 \u2013 Asphalt Pavements  December 2022  35  Posted Speed Limit (mph)  40 \u2013 45 50 IRI (Inches per Mile)  55 \u2013 65  Pay Adjustment (Percent)  55 and Under 56 \u2013 62 63 \u2013 70 71 \u2013 80  45 and Under 46 \u2013 52 53 \u2013 62 63 \u2013 70  40 and Under 41 \u2013 48 49 \u2013 55 56 \u2013 65  35 and Under 36 \u2013 40 41 \u2013 48 49 \u2013 55  +5% +4% +3% +1%  81 \u2013 100 101 \u2013 120 121 \u2013 135 136 \u2013 150 151 \u2013 170 Over 170  71 \u2013 85 86 \u2013 95 96 \u2013 110 111 \u2013 125 126 \u2013 140 Over 140  66 \u2013 75 76 \u2013 82 83 \u2013 92 93 \u2013 105 106 \u2013 120 Over 120  56 \u2013 65 66 \u2013 72 73 \u2013 82 83 \u2013 95 96 \u2013 110 Over 110  0% -5% -10% -20% -30% Corrective Action Required*  * Corrective action will be required additionally for any section or segment with surface deviation(s)  exceeding 0.25 in. when tested with a 10-ft rolling straightedge simulation analysis.

The theoretical sublot tonnage will be obtained by taking the sublot length, multiplied by half of the width of the travel lane (11 ft will be used for lane width unless otherwise indicated), multiplied  by  the  design  thickness  of  the  surface  course,  multiplied  by  the  unit  weight.    The Department  will  use  a  unit  weight  of  150.0  lb/CF  for  dense  graded  mixes  and  145.0  lb/CF  for friction course and PPEST. Theoretical tonnage values will be rounded to two decimal places.  413.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.  All corrective action required under this Section will be at no additional cost to the Department.  A pay adjustment will be determined for each sublot based upon the IRI of that sublot as described above.

            "413.03.1": " 413.03.1(3) will be totaled to yield the theoretical lot tonnage.  The sublot tonnage adjustments will be obtained by multiplying the theoretical tonnage of a sublot by the pay adjustment of that sublot.  Tonnage adjustments will not be rounded.  The sublot tonnage adjustments will be totaled to  determine  the  lot  tonnage  adjustment.    The  lot  tonnage  adjustment  will  be  divided  by  the theoretical lot tonnage to obtain the unit price adjustment for that lot.  The unit price adjustment will  be  rounded  to  six  absolute  decimal  places  for  each  lot  (i.e.,  XX.XXXX%).

This  work  consists  of  furnishing,  placing,  curing,  and  finishing  Portland  cement  concrete  for bridges, pavements, structures, and incidental construction.  Concrete  consists  of  a  homogeneous  mixture  of  Portland  cement,  coarse  aggregate,  fine aggregate, air entrainment, water, chemical and mineral admixtures (when used), mixed in the required proportions.  Proportion Portland cement concrete with the required cement content for each class and mix to the consistency specified.  Use the classes of concrete required for the work.  The Engineer will approve all concrete mixes.  Various  sizes  of  coarse  aggregate  for  the  classes  of  concrete  may  be  combined  during  the batching operation in each fraction of aggregate size required to obtain the specified gradation. When  testing  aggregates  to  determine  compliance  with  a  specified  gradation,  fractions  will  be tested  separately  and  combined  mathematically  or  combined  mechanically  in  predetermined proportions and tested.  601.02  MATERIALS.

Trial  Runs.    Once  the  concrete  mix  design  has  been  reviewed  and  no exception taken by the Engineer, conduct trial runs before production using the mix design\u2019s  component  materials  and  proportions,  including  the  amount  of  admixtures that will be necessary to meet the specifications and produce concrete of the required plasticity, workability, air content, compressive strength, flexural strength, or any other specified concrete property.  Conduct the trial runs by employing the concrete batch plant,  mixer,  and  handling  equipment  proposed  to  use  in  production.  Calibrate  all equipment employed in the batching, mixing, transporting, and testing, and meet the requirements listed herein before initiating the trial runs.  Pursue the goal of producing concrete  using  the  maximum  amount  of  water  and  air  content  specified  in  the submitted mix design during the trial runs.  Notify the Engineer at least 48 hours in advance of performing the trial runs so that the test procedures can be witnessed.  Once the concrete temperature, slump, and air content are tested and compliance with the  Specifications  has  been  established,  the  Engineer  will  fabricate  compressive strength specimens to be tested by the Engineer.  When all specified concrete parameters have been met, the Engineer will accept the proposed mix design for production.  The accepted mix design proportions will govern during the progress of the work.  Do  not  make  any  changes  in  the  sources  or  proportions  of  the  materials,  including aggregate size, without written approval of the Engineer.  Do not use new materials until the Engineer approves a revised mix design and new proportions based on a trial batch and laboratory tests and a minimum 3 cu yd batch plant trial run.  Trial batch laboratory  testing  shall  be  conducted  by  an  AASHTO  accredited  laboratory  at  no additional cost to the Department.

Determine drying according to the procedure in AASHTO T160 with the following clarifications:  Specimens are 3 in. \u00d7 3 in. \u00d7 11.25 in. prisms.  Moist cure all specimens in a saturated lime water bath for seven days before exposure to the drying environment.  The specimen length is taken upon  demolding  after  the  curing  period  and  weekly  for  28  days  while  placed  in  the drying  environment.    Calculate  the  shrinkage  value  after  28  days  of  drying  as  the percent change in length from the time the specimen is removed from curing.  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-7     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  \u25cf  Ensure that all combinations of aggregate and cementitious materials used in concrete mixes  are  innocuous  to  alkali-aggregate  reactivity  as  demonstrated  by  a  mean expansion not greater than or equal to 0.10 percent after 14 days of soaking using the ASTM C 1567 test method.  Ensure that this requirement is satisfied for an aggregate if the mean expansion in an AASHTO T303 test after 14 days of soaking is less than or equal to 0.10 percent.  Test coarse and fine aggregates separately.  A series of tests with the reactive aggregate and different cement replacement levels may be required to determine the minimum cement replacement level necessary to mitigate expansion  for  a  given  combination  of  materials.    Do  not  determine  the  minimum replacement level by interpolation between tested levels.  Batching Plants and Equipment.  a.  General.    Ensure  that  batching  plants  meet  AASHTO  M  157  and  are  certified  by  the National Ready Mix Concrete Association (NRMCA).  Weigh cement independently on a separate scale.  Ensure that the weighing hopper is properly sealed and vented.  b.  Cement Silos.  Provide separate silos or holding bins for each cement type and mineral admixture.  Ensure that the bins protect the cement and mineral admixture from rain and moisture.  On a weekly basis, maintain a log documenting deliveries, which will include the brand, supply, location, type, quantity, and date to document the cement on hand.  Ensure that all received cement conforms to the specified quality requirements.  Ensure that the log also contains data on the quantitative distribution of all cement used on both private and State projects.  Submit copies of the log to the Engineer upon request, attested to by the Contractor or its representative.  c.  Scales.  Calibrate all plant scales and water meters, including truck scales, involved in the  plant operation using a registered scale company as follows:  \u25cf  Annually before use in State work \u25cf  At intervals of not more than 180 calendar days \u25cf  At any time ordered by the Engineer  Note:   Every 180 days, the plant owner shall submit to the Engineer a certificate from the registered scale company making the checks attesting to the accuracy of all plant scales.    The  certificate  shall  be  signed  by  the  technician  or  a  responsible representative of the scale company making the check.  d.  Automation and Recordation.

Ensure  that  the devices  include  equipment  for  accurately  proportioning  batches  of  the  various components of the mixture by weight or volume in the proper sequence.  Proportion  600-8  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE        Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  cement  and  aggregates  by  weight.    Proportion  water  and  admixtures  by  weight  or volume.  Adjust the batch weights as needed when aggregate moistures change to account for the actual moisture content of the aggregates at time of use.  Equip plants automatically to control the batching sequence and timing of operations.  Provide an auxiliary  interlock  cutoff  circuit  to  interrupt  and  stop  the  automatic  cycling  of  the batching  operations  when  an  error  in  weighing  occurs,  when  an  aggregate  bin becomes empty, or when there is a malfunction of any portion of the control system.  \u25cf  Recording Equipment.  Equip the plant with a recording device that automatically prints the following data on delivery tickets and reproduces the reading of the scale being recorded within \u00b10.1 percent of scale capacity:  \u25cb  Approved mix design  \u25cb  Batch weights and storage bins for each size aggregate  \u25cb  Total  weight  of  aggregates  in  batch;  ensure  that  the  weight  printed  for  the  last aggregate batched is the total weight of aggregate in the batch when cumulative weights are used  \u25cb  Weight of cement and/or mineral admixtures and storage silo designation  \u25cb  Weight or volume of water  \u25cb  Weight or volume of admixtures  \u25cb  Date batched  \u25cb  Time of each batch or load  \u25cb  Tare zero balance to within \u00b10.3 percent of scale capacity  \u25cb  Total size of batch  \u25cb  Name of customer  \u25cb  Name of Project and RI Project Contract Number  \u25cb  Name of trucker and truck number  Include the following information on the delivery ticket:  \u25cb  Signature of Materials Inspector (Plant)* \u25cb  Amount of water and/or admixtures added at the point of delivery \u25cb  Signature of Construction Inspector (Site)*  *   Signatures  do  not  indicate  \u201cacceptance\u201d  of  the  material  but  only  signify  that  the  required inspection/witnessing has been accomplished.  Provide sufficient copies of delivery tickets to provide a copy for the plant inspector and a copy for the Construction Manager for the permanent Project record.  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-9         Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  \u25cf  Equipment Failure.  If at any time the recording devices become inoperative, the plant may be allowed to batch materials for a period of not more than one work day from the time of breakdown, if approved by the Engineer.  Written permission of the Engineer will  be  required  for  periods  of  operations  without  automatic  proportioning  facilities longer than one work day.  As a condition for continued use with inoperative recording devices, manually record all required information on all delivery tickets.  \u25cf  Batching Controls.  Ensure that batching controls are electrically interlocked with the scales to prevent cycling or recycling of batching until scales tare zero.  Ensure that the  batching  controls  meet  the  following  tolerances  with  respect  to  the  various components weighed in each batch:  \u25cb  Coarse Aggregate:  \u00b12.0 percent of required weight of the total coarse aggregate being weighed  \u25cb  Fine Aggregate:  \u00b12.0 percent of required weight of the total fine aggregate being weighed  \u25cb  Portland Cement:  \u00b11.0 percent of required weight of cement being weighed  \u25cb  Mineral admixtures:  \u00b11.0 percent of required weight of mineral admixtures being  weighed  \u25cb  Water:  \u00b11.0  percent  of  required  weight  or  volume  of  water  being  weighed  \u25cb  Admixtures:  \u00b13.0 percent of required weight or volume of each admixture being used  Ensure that the total weight of the batch does not vary more than \u00b11.0 percent from the theoretical design weight.  Concrete Mixing, Delivery, and Discharge.  Concrete  may  be  mixed  at  the  site  of  construction,  at  a  central  point,  or  in  transit  mixers,  all according to the Specifications.  a.  Equipment  \u2014  Mixers  and  Agitators.    Provide  mixers  and  agitators  that  meet  the requirements  of  AASHTO  M  157.    When  the  concrete  is  truck-mixed,  ensure  that  the volume  of  concrete  mixed  per  batch  does  not  exceed  the  mixer\u2019s  nominal  capacity  as shown on the manufacturer\u2019s standard rating plate on the mixer.  An exception is that an overload of up to 10 percent above the mixer\u2019s nominal capacity may be permitted, if the concrete test data for strength, segregation, and uniform consistency are satisfactory and if no spillage of concrete occurs.  Equip truck mixers and agitators so that the number of revolutions of the drum, blades, or paddles  may  be readily verified.    Ensure that  truck  mixers  can measure the  amount  of water added during retempering such as a water meter or other method.  600-10  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE                                    Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  b.  Mixing and Delivery.  Mix and deliver ready-mixed concrete according to AASHTO M 157. Ensure  that  ready-mix  concrete  delivery  trucks  are  National  Ready  Mixed  Concrete Association (NRMCA) (nrmca.org) certified via a non-expired certificate affixed to the truck in a location readily visible to the inspector (see Section 5 of NRMCA Plant Inspector\u2019s Guide).  c.  Discharge.  \u25cf  Time and Rate.  Ensure that the elapsed time from when water is added to the mix until  concrete  is  discharged  into  the  forms  at  the  site  of  work  does  not  exceed  90 minutes when hauled in truck-mixers or truck agitators or 30 minutes when concrete is hauled by non-agitating equipment.  Waste any concrete that is not discharged into its final place within 90 minutes (30 minutes when using non-agitating equipment) after batching.  Approved  set-control  admixtures  may  be  used  to  extend  the  maximum  time  of discharge  for  ready-mixed  concrete  delivered  in  truck  mixers  to  120  minutes,  if  the Contractor submits trial mix data subject to the following conditions:  \u25cb  The  concrete  mixture  proportions  and  prequalification  test  results  have  been  approved according to Subsection 601.03.1(b).  \u25cb  Set-control  admixture  usage  is  according  to  the  admixture  manufacturer\u2019s  instructions and guidelines.  \u25cb  Trial batches of the concrete mixture without the admixture (control) and additional batches covering the anticipated range of admixture doses are conducted.  Ensure that trial batch volume is a minimum of 3 cu yd and that trial batches are conducted at the maximum water content for the approved mixture.  \u25cb  For the control batch, only sample after initial mixing.  \u25cb  For batches containing the set-control admixture, sample after initial mixing and after  30,  60,  90,  and  120  minutes.    Keep  the  truck  mixer  in  motion  between sampling intervals.  \u25cb  \u25cb  Include  for  each  trial  batch  data  for  plastic  properties  (slump,  air  content,  unit weight, and temperature) after initial mixing and after 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of slow mixing.  Report the number of drum rotations at each sampling interval.  If  plastic  properties  are  outside  of  the  specification  limits  at  any  time  interval, retesting after high speed mixing for up to five minutes will be allowed.  \u25cb  Provide data for each trial batch that includes seven-day and 28-day (56 days for Class MC concrete) compressive strength results sampled after initial batching for the control and after initial batching and 120 minutes of slow mixing for batches containing the set-control admixture.  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-11     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  \u25cb  Ensure that trial batch test results that indicate the concrete properties of mixtures containing  the  set-control  admixture  meet  specification  requirements  after  120 minutes of slow mixing.  \u25cf  Retempering.  Retempering is defined as adjusting concrete properties by the addition of water or chemical admixtures after initial batching.  Retempering concrete by adding water or other means may be permitted only 1) after concrete arrival and initial testing on the jobsite, 2) when delivered in truck mixers, and 3) if permitted by the Engineer. When authorized, additional water or chemical admixtures may be added to the batch materials  with  additional  mixing  to  increase  slump  or  air  entrainment  to  meet  the specified requirements, if:  \u25cb  The maximum water-cementitious materials ratio is not exceeded.  \u25cb  The admixture doses do not exceed the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  \u25cb  All retempering and retesting operations are completed at least 30 minutes before  the maximum allowable discharge time limit.  Add all admixtures at the plant.  The Engineer may approve the addition of withheld mixing water at the jobsite with a metered pressurized wand.  Do not add admixture during retempering that is not present in the approved mixture.  Before allowing retempering with water-reducing admixtures on the Project, conduct trial batches to simulate the impact of delayed additions as follows:  \u25cb  Both the control and retempered batch contains the same plant-added admixture  dose.  \u25cb  The retempered batch has the second dose of admixture added at least 30 minutes  before the maximum discharge time.  \u25cb  The combination of plant added admixture dose and retempered admixture dose  does not exceed the maximum manufacturer\u2019s recommended dose.  \u25cb  Plastic  properties  are sampled  initially  at the  time  of retempering  and maximum  discharge time.  \u25cb  Specimens for strength and time of set for both the control and retempered mixture  are sampled at the maximum allowed discharge time.  No trial batches are required for retempering with air entrainment admixtures.  If additional water will be incorporated into the concrete, revolve the drum not less than 30 revolutions  at  the  mixing  speed  immediately  after  retempering  the  concrete  and  before discharge is commenced.  If additional admixtures are incorporated into the concrete, revolve the drum between 30 to  60  revolutions  at  the  mixing  speed  immediately  after  retempering  the  concrete  and before discharge is commenced.  600-12  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  Do not use concrete that is not within the specified slump or air content limits at the time of  placement.    Retemper  the  concrete  at  the  site  as  permitted  by  the  Engineer. Retempering with admixtures will be permitted only with the approval of the Engineer or when specifically provided for in the Contract.  Limitations for Mixing and Placement.  Do  not  mix,  place,  or  finish  concrete  when  the  natural  light  is  insufficient,  unless  an  adequate artificial lighting system is operational.  During and immediately after placement, protect the concrete from the adverse effects of rain.  When there is a probability of air temperature 40\u00b0F or less at the time of placement, or when there is a local forecast indicating that the temperature will be below 40\u00b0F during the five-day (cast in place  masonry)  or  14-day (bridge  deck)  curing  period, cold  weather  concreting,  as  defined  in Subsection  601.03.5,  will  apply.    At  least  24  hours  before placement, submit a  request for approval by the Engineer to use a cold weather concreting and curing plan detailing the methods and equipment to ensure that the concrete temperature does not fall below 50\u00b0F during the curing period after placement, which is considered the protection period.  Ensure that concrete mixing operations conform to Subsection 601.03.5.  Cold Weather Concrete.  a. Plant  Procedures.   When  concreting  is  authorized  during  cold  weather, the  aggregates and/or water may be heated by either steam or dry heat before being placed in the mixer. Ensure  that  the  apparatus  heats  the  mass  uniformly  and  is  arranged  to  preclude  the possible occurrence of overheated areas that might damage the materials.  Ensure that the temperature of the mixed concrete is not less than 50\u00b0F and not more than 90\u00b0F at the time of placement in the forms.  Do not use frozen aggregates in the concrete.  Stockpiled  aggregates  may  be  heated  by  the  use  of  dry  heat  or  steam.    Do  not  heat aggregates directly by gas or oil flame or on sheet metal over fire.  When aggregates are heated in bins, steam-coil, water-coil heating, or other methods that will not be detrimental to the aggregates may be used.  Do not use live steam on or through binned aggregates without the approval of the Engineer.  b. Concrete  Placement  Procedures.    Do  not  place  concrete  on  frozen  subgrade.    Install sufficient heating devices under an enclosure or covering that are capable of maintaining at  all  times  and  under  all  weather  conditions  during  the  protection  period  a  uniform concrete temperature of not less than 50\u00b0F.  From days 8 to 14 of the concrete bridge deck  curing  period,  maintain  a  minimum  concrete  temperature  of  not  less  than  40\u00b0F. Arrange  heating  devices  to  prevent  overheating  any  forms  or  concrete.    Before  any concrete  is  placed,  ensure  that  the  enclosure  and  heating  apparatus  are  as  nearly complete as the placement of concrete will permit.  Ensure that the minimum temperature is continuously maintained around deposited concrete for the curing period of five days (cast  in  place  masonry)  or  14  days  (bridge  deck)  or  56  days  (Class  MC  concrete)  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-13  Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  immediately  after  concrete  has  been  placed  and  then  reduced  gradually  so  that  the concrete will not be subjected to a sudden change in temperature.  The heating period may be reduced when the concrete units will not be subjected to any appreciable bending stress from dead or live load until after seasonal conditions have permitted normal curing.  A steam heating system may be used to supply heat during the protection period to ensure a minimum temperature of 40\u00b0F before concrete placement.  Heat for protection may be supplied by any method that will maintain the required concrete temperature of not less than 50\u00b0F.  When methods other than live steam are used, make provisions in the enclosure being heated to maintain a humid condition of sufficient vapor (maintain humidity of 100 percent) content to prevent evaporation of the moisture in the concrete.  Provide  adequate fire  protection  when  heating  is  in  progress  and  provide  watchmen  or other attendants to keep heating units in continuous operation.  Do not use open fires.  Maintain a daily permanent record of the concrete surface temperatures throughout the curing period with the use of a 24-hour, continuous temperature recording device.  The Engineer will retain these records.  During  freezing  weather,  seal  all  keyways,  anchor  bolt  holes,  or  other  depressions  in exposed horizontal concrete surfaces against the admission of water.  Repair damage to the concrete from freezing water in the depressions if practical, or replace the concrete as directed by the Engineer.  Hot Weather Concrete.  Hot  weather  is  defined  in  The  American  Concrete  Institute,  Standard  305.    During  concreting operations in hot weather, take appropriate measures to reduce the hazards of an increased rate of  cement  hydration,  flash  set,  loss  of  water  due  to  evaporation,  high  concrete  ingredient temperatures,  and  the  increased  difficulty  of  concrete  placing  and  finishing.    Comply  with  the following requirements during concrete placement operations in hot weather:  a.  Concrete  Temperature.    Ensure  that  the  temperature  of  the  concrete  at  the  point  of  discharge does not exceed 90\u00b0F.  b.  Cooling Materials.  The Contractor may reduce the temperature of the concrete by cooling one or more of several ingredients.  Use chipped or crushed ice in the mix as a portion of the  mixing  water  on  a  pound  for  pound  basis,  provided  that  the  measurement  is determined at the time of placement in the mix.  If used, melt all ice before the batch is discharged from the mixing unit.  c.  Concrete  Placement.    Immediately  before  the  concrete  is  placed,  cool  the  forms  and reinforcement  steel  by  spraying  with  water.    Do  not  allow  any  standing  water  in  the concrete  forms  from  the  spraying  procedures.    Ensure  that  sufficient  skilled  staff  and adequate equipment are available to place the concrete without delays.  600-14  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE      Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  d.  Finishing.  To prevent thermal and shrinkage cracking resulting from moisture loss, use effective means to supply moisture.  Ensure that finishing operations follow as closely as practical behind the placing operation so that curing may begin as soon as possible.  Curing.  a.   Curing.  Ensure that the temperature on the surface of the hardened concrete does not  fall below 50\u00b0F at any time during the first five days of curing.  Initiate  curing  operations  on  all  exposed  surfaces  immediately  after  the  placing  and finishing  operations  have  been  completed.    Select  a  method  of  curing  that  does  not damage the concrete surface before final set occurs and continue its use throughout the work,  unless  the  Engineer  determines  that  the  curing  plan  results  in  unsatisfactory concrete curing.  Any changes in the method of curing must be authorized in writing.  When curing requires the  use  of  water,  ensure  that  the  curing  has  priority  for  all  water  supply  or  suppliers. Failure  to  provide  sufficient  cover  material  or  lack  of  water  to  adequately  protect  both curing  and  other  requirements  will  result  in  immediate  suspension  of  concreting operations.  Do not allow the concrete to remain exposed for more than \u00bd hour between stages of curing and during the curing period.  b.  Water Method.  Ensure that the concrete remains continuously wet by the application of  water for a minimum period of seven days after the concrete has been placed.  A curing medium meeting the requirements of Subsection M02.04 may be used to retain the moisture during the curing period.  When a curing medium will be used to retain the moisture, ensure that the entire surface of the concrete remains damp by applying water with a nozzle so that the flow is atomized in the form of a mist rather than a spray until the surface  of  the  concrete  is  covered  with  the  curing  medium.    Do  not  apply  the  moisture from the nozzle under pressure directly upon the concrete and do not allow moisture to accumulate on the concrete in a quantity sufficient to cause a flow or wash the surface.  c.  Curing  Compound  Method.  that  complies  with Subsection M02.04.  For concrete that is treated with any additional coatings or overlays, do not cure as provided in this Section.  Use  a  curing  compound  Spray  the  surfaces  of  the  concrete  that  are  exposed  to  the  air  uniformly  with  a  curing compound.  Apply the curing compound according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation.  Evaluate runs, sags, thin areas, skips, or holidays in the applied curing as evidence that the application is not satisfactory.  If a clear color curing compound is used, add a fugitive dye to the curing compound to ensure complete coverage.  Apply  the  curing  compound  to  the  concrete  following  the  surface  finishing  operation immediately  before  the  moisture  sheen  disappears  from  the  surface,  but  before  any drying, shrinkage, or craze cracks begin to appear.  If any drying or cracking of the surface is evident, immediately apply water with an atomizing nozzle as specified above for the  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-15      Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  Water  Method,  and  continue  until  application  of  the  compound  is  started  or  resumed. However, do not apply the compound over any resulting freestanding waters.  If the film of compound is damaged from any cause before the expiration of seven days after the concrete is placed for structures and 72 hours for pavement, repair the damaged portion immediately with additional compound.  Do not dilute or alter the curing compound after manufacture.  When the curing compound is shipped in tanks or tank trucks, provide a shipping invoice with each load.  Ensure that the invoice contains the same information as that required for container labels.  Curing compounds may be sampled by the Engineer at the source of supply, at the job site, or at both locations.  Use the curing compound within 120 days of its manufacture.  All  tests  will  be  conducted  by  the  Engineer  according  to  the  latest  test  methods  of  the American Society for Testing Materials.  d.  Waterproof  Membrane  Method.    Spray  the  exposed  finished  surfaces  of  concrete  with water, using a nozzle that atomizes the flow so that a mist and not a spray is formed, until the  concrete  has  set,  after  which  place  the  curing  membrane.    Ensure  that  the  curing membrane remains in place for a period of not less than 72 hours.  Use sheeting material for curing concrete that conforms to Subsection M02.04.2.  Use sheeting material that has been fabricated into sheets of a width to provide a cover for the entire concrete surface.  Securely cement together all joints in the sheets to provide a waterproof joint.  Ensure that the joint seams have a minimum lap of 6 in.  Securely weigh down the sheets by means satisfactory to the Engineer.  Do not use rocks, sand, or loose debris as ballast.  Should any portion of the sheets be broken or damaged before the expiration of 72 hours after  being  placed,  repair  the  broken  or  damaged  portions  with  new  sheets  properly secured into place.  Do not use sections of membrane that have lost their waterproof qualities or have been damaged that renders them unfit for curing the concrete.  e.  Forms-In-Place  Method.    Formed  surfaces  of  concrete  may  be  cured  by  retaining  the forms  in  place.    Ensure  that  the  forms  remain  in  place  for  a  minimum  period  of  seven continuous days after the concrete has been placed, except that, for members over 20 in. in  least  dimension,  ensure  that  the  forms  remain  in  place  for  a  minimum  period  of  five continuous  days.    Remove  the  forms  no  later  than  three  weeks  after  the  concrete  has been placed.  600-16  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  Ensure that all joints in the forms and the joints between the end of forms and concrete remain moisture tight during the curing period.  Reseal any cracks in the forms and cracks between the forms and the concrete by methods approved by the Engineer.  Quality Assurance (QA).  a.  Concrete Manufacturing Plant Quality Control (QC).  \u25cf  General.    The  Concrete  Producer  shall  establish,  implement,  and  maintain  a  QC program  to  control  all  equipment,  materials,  and  processes  during  concrete production.

The  following  is  the acceptance plan necessary to obtain samples, perform tests, and provide inspection of the work.  The terms used in this acceptance plan are defined as follows:  600-22  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  \u25cf  Placement.    For  a  given  class  of  concrete,  the  portions  of  a  concrete  structure  constructed during one continuous concrete operation.  \u25cf  Acceptance Plan.  The method of taking measurements of samples to determine the acceptability  of  a  placement  of  material  or  construction.    Acceptance  plans  include random sampling plans.  \u25cf  Random Sample.  A sample chosen so that each increment in the lot has an equal probability of being selected.  The Engineer reserves the right to take more samples in addition to the samples taken according to the random sampling plan.  \u25cf  Acceptance.  As defined in Para. c below.  \u25cf  Rejection.  When used in this context, \u201crejection\u201d means remove, dispose, and replace at no cost to the Department or, at the discretion of the Engineer, \u201crejection\u201d means acceptance at a lower price determined by Pay Factors, as specified herein.  \u25cf  Lot.  An isolated quantity of material from a single source or a measured amount of construction produced by the same process.  For placements less than 750 cu yd, the Lot is 150 cu yd or less.  For placements of 750 cu yd or greater, the Lot is 250 cu yd or less.  Lots will be determined as follows:  \u25cb  The total cubic yards for the placement will be divided by 150 for placements less  than 750 cu yd, and 250 for placements greater than or equal to 750 cu yd.  \u25cb  The result will be rounded up to the next whole number.  This number is the number  of Lots in the placement.  \u25cb  The  total  cubic  yards  for  the  placement  in  the  first  bullet  will  be  divided  by  the  number in the second bullet to determine Lot size.  \u25cb  Each Lot size will be adjusted by rounding to the nearest 10 cu yd (or other number representing one truck load), and this adjusted Lot size will be used to determine the number of trucks in the Lot.  \u25cb  For the acceptance plan, the total cubic yards of concrete placed for all Lots will  be the placement volume.  \u25cf  Sublots.  Equal divisions or portions of a Lot are as defined below.  The Sublot size for each Lot will be calculated by dividing each Lot into thirds rounded to the nearest truck.  \u25cb  Cylinders  will  be  cast  for  each  placement  less  than  or  equal  to  150  cu  yd  of  concrete delivered for each class of concrete according to the following:  +  1 truck  =   4 cylinders from the truck  (6 cylinders for Class MC concrete)  +  2 trucks =  4 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck  (6 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck for Class MC concrete)  SECTION 601 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE  600-23           Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  +  3 trucks =  2 cylinders from each of 2 randomly selected trucks  (3 cylinders from each of 2 randomly selected trucks for Class MC concrete)  +  4 thru 10 trucks =  2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the first half the  of the placement and 2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck second half of the placement.  from  (3 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the first half of the placement and  3  cylinders  from  1  randomly  selected  truck  from  the  second  half  of  the placement for Class MC concrete).  +  11 thru 15 trucks = 2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the first third  of  the  placement,  2  cylinders  from  1  randomly  selected  truck  from  the second third of the placement and 2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the final third of the placement.  \u25cb  Cylinders will be cast for each placement greater than 150 cu yd and less than 750  cu yd of concrete delivered for each class of concrete according to the following:  +  2  cylinders  from  1  randomly  selected  truck  from  the  first  third  of  the  Lot,  2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the second third of the Lot, and 2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the final third of the Lot.  \u25cb  Cylinders  will  be  cast for  each  placement  greater  than  or  equal to  750  cu  yd  of  concrete delivered for each class of concrete according to the following:  +  2  cylinders  from  1  randomly  selected  truck  from  the  first  third  of  the  Lot,  2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the second third of the Lot, and 2 cylinders from 1 randomly selected truck from the final third of the Lot.

The peak temperature is defined as the average of the values measured at any given time by the two temperature sensors placed at the location of the highest temperature as determined by the thermal model for the structural element.  The highest acceptable peak temperature is 155\u00b0F.  The differential temperature is defined as the difference in values measured at any given time between the temperature sensor(s) in any given location (or the average, if two sensors are placed in the location) in the structural element and the peak temperature as defined above.  The highest acceptable differential temperature until the completion of temperature control is 35\u00b0F.  The performance-based differential temperature is defined as a limit that changes as the concrete gains strength, determined as a function of the established maturity curve for the mix.  This option may be considered by the Engineer, with the proper submission of an implementation plan for the process.  607.02  MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT.  Concrete.  Use  concrete that meets  SECTION 808  and  SECTION  601.   Do  not  use  calcium  nitrite-based corrosion  inhibitor.    Any  proposed  mixture  adjustment  that  meets  SECTION  601  for  a  new approval  of  the mix  design  will  also require  a  new  approval  of the  mass concrete temperature control plans per this specification.  Temperature And Maturity Recording.  Design  primary  temperature  measuring  loggers  specifically  for  determining  the  maturity  of concrete according to ASTM C1074.  Operate the loggers in the range of 30\u00b0F to 212\u00b0F to an accuracy  of  \u00b11\u00b0F  and  internally  record  the  time  and  temperature  at  a  minimum  of  one-hour intervals for a minimum of 90 days.  Ensure that each logger has a unique serial number and, upon  download  of  the  information  using  the  compatible  reader  or  other  appropriate  data connection, produce a secure, (unalterable) Windows PC-readable file that identifies the logger  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE  600-35  Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  by its serial number and the start date.  Provide software to develop maturity curves to predict strength, and display the temperature versus time data for all loggers in a given placement.  Size  the  data  leads to reach  from the  logger\u2019s  installed  location  to  an  accessible  site  where  a handheld  reader  can  be  employed.    A  data  cable  that  can  connect  the  loggers  to  a  notebook computer  or  other  standard mobile  device  will  be  considered  equivalent to  a  handheld  reader, provided that a Windows PC-readable file can be created that can be transferred to a Windows PC.  Provide a reader and necessary software for the exclusive use of the Engineer, which will become the property of the Department at the completion of the Project.  Provide loggers that can use battery operated Wireless Remote Boxes for downloading of data. Ensure that the transmission range of the system can provide a reliable connection to both the Contractor\u2019s and Engineer\u2019s field offices.  Provide a Windows PC-Compatible Wireless System Radio Base Station that can download the data file as described above.  Maintain the Wireless System Radio Base Station for monitoring the mass concrete placement.  Provide an additional Wireless System Radio Base Station for the Engineer\u2019s field office, which will become the property of the Department at the completion of the Project.  The Engineer may waive the requirement for a wireless communications system, if the Engineer determines that access to the placement is not warranted.  Provide  the  Engineer  with  recording  equipment  that  will  allow  intermediate  downloading  of measurements to a computer without restarting the logger, which will become the property of the Department  at  the  completion  of  the  Project.    Provide  an  automatic  temperature  monitoring system  with  email,  phone,  or  text  message  alarm  capability  to  notify  the  Contractor  when temperature control limits are about to be exceeded.  Submit  technical  literature  on  the  complete  maturity  logger  system,  including  the  loggers, handheld  reader,  wireless  system,  software,  and  any  other  components  to  the  Engineer  for approval  before  the  first  mass  concrete  placement.    This  includes  manufacturer  contact information for the responsible technical representative and product performance history showing at least one year of successful use of the complete system on a minimum of three projects with mass concrete placements comparable to those within the scope of the Project.  Provide contact information for the Project owners.  Do not proceed with mass concrete placements until approval of the maturity logger system has been provided by the Engineer.  607.03  CONSTRUCTION.  Comply with the applicable construction requirements for SECTION 808 and SECTION 601, with the following additions.  Submittals.  Mass Concrete Temperature Control Plans.  Submit a Mass Concrete General Temperature Control Plan for approval before the first mass concrete placement, stamped by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer.  Include the general  procedures  proposed  for  temperature  control.    Prepare  a  Mass  Concrete  Specific Temperature  Control  Plan  for  each  unique  placement,  based  on  the  general  plan.    For  each specific temperature control plan, provide guidance, developed based on a concrete hydration  600-36  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE       Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  temperature  model  to  indicate  when  the  peak  and  differential  temperatures  might  exceed  the specification  limits.    Provide  specific  concrete  placement  temperature  restrictions  based  on anticipated ambient temperatures and other environmental factors, passive and active cooling, and insulation practices that could produce peak or differential temperatures that require remedial action.  Provide guidance on appropriate remedial actions when concrete temperatures approach specification limits.  At a minimum, ensure that the guidelines become effective when:  \u2022  The concrete peak temperature reaches 3\u00b0F below the specification limit of 155\u00b0F.  \u2022  The differential temperature reaches 2\u00b0F below the specification limit or the temperature  value at the specified maturity for the variable differential limit (if approved).  Submit  each  plan  for  approval  before  placement,  stamped  by  a  Rhode  Island  Registered Professional Engineer.  Approval  of  any Mass  Concrete  Temperature  Control  Plan  by the  Engineer  will  not  relieve  the Contractor of its responsibility to maintain concrete temperatures within specification limits.  a.  General  Mass  Concrete Temperature  Control  Plan.   Provide  a General Mass  Concrete  Temperature Control Plan that includes the following:  \u25cf  Concrete mixture proportions, indicating aggregate sources and physical properties, cementitious  material  sources,  and  admixture  product  names  and  doses  for  each concrete mixture. Submit the Class MC concrete mixture design and prequalification test results for approval separately.  \u25cf  Anticipated mass concrete placement schedule, including proposed concrete mixture adjustments for the full range of conditions that may occur during placement and curing operations.  \u25cf  Test  concrete  temperature  rise  for  each  mixture  directly  in  an  adiabatic  concrete calorimeter  cast  from  laboratory  trial  batches  using  the  same  material  sources  and proportions as intended for use on the Project.  \u25cf  Concrete  compressive  strength  development  in  standard  moist  curing  environment (73.5\u00b0 \u00b13.5\u00b0F) at 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days for each mixture, based on the average of three 6 in. \u00d7 12 in. cylinders for each age.  Cure the cylinders and test per AASHTO T22.  Cast a temperature sensor in the center of two additional cylinders, and cure these cylinders alongside those used for compressive strength.  Record the average temperatures of the cylinders hourly.  Report the compressive strength and maturity for each specimen at each test age and the average values.  \u25cf  Calculate  and  report  the  concrete  strength  development-maturity  equation  for  each mixture  from  the  standard  cured  strength  results  as  described  in  ASTM  C1074, Estimating Concrete Strength by the Maturity Method.  \u25cf  Perform demonstration mock-up(s) at least 60 days before the first scheduled mass concrete  placement.    Cast  at  least  one mock-up to  verify  that  the concrete  thermal properties  and  temperature  control  procedures  required  for  the  Mass  Concrete General Temperature Control Plan are adequate to meet the specification limits.  For the  mock-up(s),  use  the  same  concrete  mixture  proportions  and  materials,  form  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE  600-37     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  in  materials,  curing  materials,  and  monitoring  devices  defined the  General Temperature  Control  Plan,  and  use the  same  batching  and  placing  operation  to  be used for the Project.  Ensure that the mock-up is a cube or other element measuring 4  ft  or  more  in  the  least  dimension.    Ensure  that  the  temperature  monitoring  of  the mock-up is as specified in the General Mass Concrete Temperature Control Plan, and continue for at least seven days.  At a minimum, insulate the demonstration mock-up with R-20 insulation on all sides.  If alternative insulation, cooling, or curing options are proposed,  cast  a  separate  demonstration  mock-up  cube,  instrumented  for  each alternative.  The Engineer responsible for the design of the temperature control plan shall be present at the placement for each mock-up.  For sensor placement, comply with the following:  \u25cf  Locate two sensors at the center of the mock-up.  Use the average of the two.  \u25cf  Locate two sensors within 1 in. from the top surface located directly above the center  of mass sensors.  Use the average of the two.  \u25cf  Locate two sensors within 1 in. from the center of a vertical face.  Use the average of  the two.  \u25cf  Locate two sensors in an upper corner of the cube.  Use the average of the two.  \u25cf  Use one sensor to record the ambient temperature.  Place this sensor at approximately  10 ft from the placement in a shaded area.  Note:  For a 5\u00b0F or greater variation between sensors of a paired set, or erratic variations or outright failure of a sensor, notify the Engineer immediately upon discovery of the problem.  At the time of the notification, provide the Engineer with a course of corrective action for approval.  If the approved corrective action requires that the data from one sensor in a pair no longer be used, use the other functioning sensor solely for the peak and maximum differential temperature measurements.  From the concrete batched for the mock-up, conduct tests for air content (AASHTO T152), placement temperature (ASTM C1064), and unit weight (AASHTO T121), and fabricate cylinders (per AASHTO T23) from the same concrete by an ACI Certified Concrete Field Technician Level I.  Test the cylinders for compression strength by an AASHTO-accredited independent  concrete  testing  laboratory  (AASHTO  T22)  at  3,  7,  14,  28,  and  56  days. Coordinate the mock-up with the Engineer, and provide the Department with at least one week advance notice of the casting date.  Provide the Engineer with the opportunity to witness the placement and functioning of temperature recording sensors before casting, and perform concrete property tests on companion samples selected by the Engineer.  If a mix design has been approved for mass concrete placement before the scheduled first placement  and  the  testing  conforms  to  these  standards,  the  Engineer  may  waive  the requirements  of  Subsection  607.03.1.1(a)  (first  six  bullets).    However,  perform  any requirements  for  testing/analysis  added  after  the  aforementioned  mix  design  was approved,  with  the  exception  that  mix  designs  previously  approved  using  data  derived from semi-adiabatic testing will not require re-testing per the above requirements.  If the approved mix  design  has  already  had  a mock-up  performed  previously and  the criteria  600-38  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE        Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  matches  that  for  the  applicable  temperature  control  plan,  the  Engineer  may  accept  the results of the previous mock-up instead of running a new one.  Submit a letter report documenting the concrete properties and temperatures developed in  the  mock-up  compared  against  the  thermal  analysis  contained  in  the  General  Mass Concrete General Temperature Control Plan models as part of the General Temperature Control Plan.  Outline any revisions/corrections required to the General Mass Concrete Temperature  Control  Plan  for  differing  ambient  conditions  in the  letter  report.   Strength results may be submitted separately.  If  the  Project  involves  four  or  fewer  unique  mass  concrete  placement  designs,  the Engineer may waive the requirement for a General Mass Concrete Temperature Control Plan.  If waived, ensure that the Specific Mass Concrete Temperature Control Plans meets all above requirements.  b.  Specific  Mass  Concrete  Temperature  Control  Plans.    For  each  Specific  Concrete  Temperature Control Plan, include the following:  \u25cf  Form and form liner R-value and anticipated time of form removal.  \u25cf  Insulating material(s) R-value and anticipated periods of use.  \u25cf  Curing procedure and duration.  \u25cf  Provide thermal modeling analysis for typical placement scenarios.  Ensure that the  analysis incorporates:  \u25cb  A range of anticipated ambient placement temperatures \u25cb  Anticipated water temperatures for active cooling \u25cb  Effects of water temperature for placements in water \u25cb  Effects of convection cooling in locations where high winds may be a factor \u25cb  Anticipated concrete placement temperatures \u25cb  Assumed R-values for concrete forms and insulation \u25cb  Calculated maximum core and surface temperatures vs. time after placement  Include  the  impact  of  planned  construction  activities,  such  as  form  removal,  in  the analysis.  Estimate the concrete strength at form removal from the maturity relationship using  the  lowest  calculated  maturity  value  shown  by  the  sensors  placed  within  the concrete.  \u25cf  Provide  drawings  that  identify  the  temperature  monitoring  locations  for  each placement and product data for all sensors and recording instrumentation.  With the exception  of  the  ambient  sensor,  install  the  sensors  in  pairs  for  the  redundancy. Ensure that the minimum number of automated temperature monitoring locations is nine  per  element  for  placements  less  than  500  cu  yd  and  17  per  element  for placements 500 cu yd or larger.  Minimum sensor locations are noted below.  Place each of the sensors in a pair in separate locations, no less than 6 in. and no more than 18 in. apart.  For the mock-ups, the relative locations are as shown.  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE  600-39     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  \u25cb  Place two sensors in the center of thermal mass of the placement, where the peak temperature will occur.  Determine this location based on the isocurves developed for the model, with the approval of the Engineer.  Use the average of the two to determine the peak temperature at any given time and to measure the maximum temperature  differential  in  the  placement  based  on  the  difference  between  the peak temperature and each sensor location at any given time.  Use the average of the two sensors.  \u25cb  Place two sensors at the location as determined by isocurves developed for the model  that  shows  the  point  where  the  lowest  temperature  is  predicted  during temperature control.  Use the average of the two sensors.  \u25cb  Locate  two  sensors  within  1  in.  from  the  top  surface  located  directly  above  the center  of  thermal  mass  sensors.    This  location  may  be  adjusted,  based  on  the isocurves  developed for the  model,  with the  approval  of  the  Engineer.    Use  the average of the two sensors.  \u25cb  Locate two sensors within 1 in. from the center of vertical formed surfaces at mid- height.  This location may be adjusted, based on the isocurves developed for the model, with the approval of the Engineer.  Use the average of the two sensors.  \u25cb  Use  one  sensor  to  record  the  ambient  temperature.    Place  this  sensor  at  approximately 10 ft from the placement in a shaded area.  \u25cb  Provide  up  to  four  additional  sensor  pairs  to  be  located  at  the  discretion  of  the  Engineer.  \u25cb  Use similar sensor distribution for placements greater than 500 cu yd.  Note:    For  a  5\u00b0F  or  greater  variation  between  sensors  of  a  paired  set,  or  erratic variations or outright failure of a sensor, notify the Engineer immediately upon discovery of the problem.  At the time of the notification, provide the Engineer with a course of corrective action for approval.  If the approved corrective action requires that the  data  from  one  sensor  in  a  pair  no  longer  be  used,  use  the other  functioning  sensor  solely  for  the  peak  and  maximum  differential temperature measurements.  Provide  procedures  for  achieving  temperature  restrictions  including  contingencies  for  severe weather  events.    Procedures  may  incorporate  either  active  (cooling  pipes)  or  passive  control methods (insulation,  tenting,  venting,  etc.)  or  both.   Ensure that the  Temperature  Control  Plan identifies  the  expected  duration  of  all  temperature  control  measures  for  each  model  condition provided.  If cooling pipes are proposed, submit a detailed description of the system describing the:  \u2022  Layout and size of pipes \u2022  Anticipated coolant flow rate \u2022  Temperature of the raw coolant source \u2022  Pump size \u2022  Flow and recirculation control equipment  600-40  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  Instrumentation  \u2022 \u2022  Coolant temperature control procedure \u2022  Contingency plans  Performance-Based Variable Temperature Differential Limit.  After the Contractor has established that proper control can be maintained of the concrete mix properties, including curing temperatures, the Contractor has the option of submitting a plan to use performance-based criteria for a variable differential limit, based on the concrete strength as determined  by  the  maturity  at  any  given  time.    This  will  supersede  the  35\u00b0F  limit.    Failure  to maintain proper temperature control under this plan will result in reversion to the 35\u00b0F limit for subsequent placements until the Contractor demonstrates to the Engineer that causes for the loss of control have been identified and corrected.  Temperature control will be considered to have failed if one of the following conditions occurs:  \u2022  The differential exceeds the variable value by more than 3\u00b0F at any time during the first  40 hours after placement.  \u2022  The differential exceeds the variable value by more than 5\u00b0F at any time after the first 40  hours after placement during temperature control.  \u2022  The differential exceeds the variable value by 2\u00b0F or more for any period of eight hours or  more at any time during temperature control.  \u2022  Cracking  of  the  placement  determined  to  be  the  result  of  thermal  issues  will  also  be considered to be a failure of the temperature control and will result in reversion to the 35\u00b0F limit, and will trigger the provisions specified in Subsection 607.03.2.4.  Plan Submission Requirements.  Provide a written implementation plan that includes complete back-up data such as:  \u2022  Listing of all assumptions used in the analysis \u2022  Published reference documents \u2022  Coefficient of the thermal expansion for the mix being placed \u2022  Tensile strength development versus maturity equations for the mix being placed \u2022  Elastic modulus versus maturity equations for the mix being placed \u2022  Example implementation of the method using a predicted thermal gradient analysis \u2022  Complete test data justifying the prediction equations for the proposed mixture  Ensure  that  each  placement  also  includes  a  specific  plan  with  an  assumed  restraint  factor, consideration of the placement geometry, and other factors that can affect the differential limit. The other factors include:  \u2022  Anticipated concrete placement temperature \u2022  Ambient temperatures \u2022  Cooling water temperature (if active cooling is used) \u2022  Convection effects from wind and design elements of the temperature control plan  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE  600-41       Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  For acceptable demonstration of the submission of an implementation plan, the Contractor may use a mass concrete pour defined and conducted using the 35\u00b0F differential limit.  Ensure that the gradients predicted in the thermal model for the performance-based temperature limit match the  actual  temperatures.  Ensure  that  there  are  at  least  eleven  temperature/maturity  sensors. Locate sensors as follows:  1.  At  the  location  of  the  maximum  temperature,  place  at  least  one  sensor  as  defined  in  Subsection 607.03.1.1(b) (5th closed bullet, 1st open bullet).  2.  Near  the  formed  surface,  place  at Subsection 607.03.1.1(b) (5th closed bullet, 2nd open bullet).  least  one  sensor  as  defined  in  3.  Near the top surface, place at least one sensor as defined in Subsection 607.03.1.1(b)  (5th closed bullet, 3rd open bullet).  4.  Place a minimum of two equally spaced between the location of the maximum temperature  and top surface sensor in an approximate straight-line configuration.  5.  Locate  a  minimum  of  two  equally  spaced  between  the  location  of  the  maximum temperature and formed surface sensor in an approximate straight-line configuration.  6.  At  the  location  of  the  minimum  temperature,  place  at  least  one  sensor  as  defined  in  Subsection 607.03.1.1(b) (5th closed bullet, 4th open bullet).  7.  Locate  a  minimum  of  two  equally  spaced  between  the  location  of  the  maximum temperature and the location of the minimum temperature in an approximate straight-line configuration.  8.  Use one sensor to record the ambient temperature remote from the placement, as defined  in Subsection 607.03.1.1(b) (5th closed bullet, 5th open bullet).  For Items 1, 2, 3, and 6, the sensors may be the same as those used for the actual temperature control of the placement as specified in Subsection 607.03.1.1(b).  Although redundant sensors are not required, failure at any of the required locations without a backup will invalidate the results.  Submit the performance-based temperature limit plan for approval before the first placement for which it is proposed to be used, stamped by a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer. If the plan is approved by the Engineer, this will become the standard sensor distribution for as long  as  the  plan  is  in  effect.    Use  the  plan  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  performance-based temperature  limit  plan  thermal  model  for  each  placement.    Ensure  that  the  plan  identifies  the relationship  between  the  maturity  and  the  appropriate  maximum  acceptable  temperature differential that will prevent cracking of the concrete.  Present the relationship in tabular form, at intervals  of  1\u00b0F  for  the  first  40  hours  after  placement  and  2\u00b0F  for  more  than  40  hours  after placement  for  a  minimum  of  14  days.    Ensure  that  the  maturity  value  used  to  determine  the appropriate differential at any given time is the lowest measured within the placement.  600-42  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE      Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  Temperature Control Requirements.  Temperature Control.  Monitor  mass  concrete  temperature  control  by  maturity  loggers  cast  into  the  concrete,  as described in Subsection 607.03.1.1. The use of low heat concrete mixtures, pre-cooling of the concrete, insulated curing blankets, insulated forms, cooling pipes, and other measures may be necessary to satisfy the temperature control requirements.  Notify the Engineer immediately when temperature control limits are exceeded.  Provide  complete  concrete  temperature  records  for  each  placement  including  the  secure  files generated by the  automated  temperature  sensors  to the  Engineer.   Provide  the  Engineer  with unobstructed access to temperature sensors at any time to verify compliance with temperature control criteria.  a.  When forms are placed in water, waterproof the forms and insulation or otherwise protect against water absorption.  Determine the required combined form and insulation R-Value through  thermal  analysis  before  placement  using  forecasted  temperatures  to  meet  the requirements  to  maintain  the  maximum  peak  and  differential  temperatures  within  the required limits.  b.  Do not allow the temperature of the concrete at placement to exceed 65\u00b0F for cold weather placements  nor  85\u00b0F  for  hot  weather  placements,  unless  active  temperature  control precautions  are  employed.    Ensure  that  all  active  temperature  control  piping  is  non- metallic  and  filled  with  a  non-shrink  grout  on  the  RIDOT  Approved  Products  List  upon completion  of  cooling  operations.    Ensure  that  the  temperature  of  the  concrete  at placement is within the acceptable range of values shown in the temperature control plan for the structural element.  c.  Provide  temperature  sensors  that  are  maturity  loggers  as  described  in  Subsection ",
            "607.02.2": " 607.02.2.  Program the logger with the appropriate datum temperature.  d.  Secure wiring for loggers that must be cast into the concrete to reinforcing or otherwise protected to prevent damage during concrete placement.  The Engineer will approve the method of protection of the wires cast into the concrete.  Clearly label wiring for loggers to identify the location within the form at both ends before being placed into the form.  Locate ambient temperature sensors to be no closer than 10 ft from the mass concrete placement and  be  placed  to  provide  an  accurate  measurement  of  the  environmental  condition. Encase  wire  runs  outside  of  concrete  in  conduit  where  necessary  to  prevent  damage during subsequent construction operations.  e.  Do not perform installation and verification checks for operation of any loggers unless the Engineer is present.  Provide as-built versions of the temperature control plans showing the location of the loggers as identified by the unique serial numbers.  Upon completion of monitoring, remove all visible wires from the concrete and any conduit penetrations filled with a non-shrink grout on the RIDOT Approved Products List.  f.  Program each logger with notes identifying the placement and relative location within the placement.    Secure  loggers  into  position,  and  verify  function  at  least  one  day  before concrete  placement.    Start temperature  recording  for  each  placement  no  less  than  two  SECTION 607 \u2014 MASS CONCRETE  600-43     Part 600 \u2014 Concrete  December 2022  hours  before  the  initial  concrete  placement.    Provide  the  Engineer  safe  access  to  the locations  where  readings  will  be  taken  to  observe  the  initialization  of  the  loggers  and record relevant information.  Include each logger serial number, location in the placement, and start time.  Provide access as needed for subsequent readings.  g.  Connect each logger for each placement to the wireless remote boxes.  Provide as many wireless remote boxes as necessary to monitor all loggers simultaneously.  Ensure that a sufficient  quantity  of  wireless  remote  boxes  are  on  hand  to  monitor  all  loggers  for  all placements being actively monitored at any given time during the Project.  Maintain two spare remote boxes or 10 percent of the total on hand, whichever is larger, in operating condition at all times.  h.  Protect the units from damage due to the environment and other factors to ensure that the remote  boxes  can  retrieve  and  transmit  data  on  a  daily  basis  for  the  duration  of  the specified monitoring period for the concrete placement.  i.  Provide  at the  Contractor\u2019s  field  office  a  wireless  system radio  base station  compatible with the wireless remote boxes and provide the same model to the Engineer, as described in Subsection 607.02.2.  Configure both wireless system radio base stations to access all  active  wireless remote  boxes  at  any time  without reconfiguration  of  any  component. Upon setup of each wireless remote box and before placement of the concrete, test the remote  operation  of  the  system  to  verify  that  it  works  properly  and  that  all  loggers connected  to  the  wireless  remote  box  can  be  accessed.    The  Contractor  may,  at  its discretion, have a handheld reader for the loggers.  However, do not use the handheld reader except to configure the loggers initially or to collect data if a problem with a wireless remote box occurs.  Correct any problem within 24 hours.  Upon connection/reconnection of a wireless remote box, test the operation as described above.  j.  Download  automated  temperature  measurements  within  one  hour  of  the  start  of  each calendar day when any element of temperature control is in place.  Provide secure data files from each logger to the Engineer on a daily basis.  k.  Do  not  allow  the  peak  concrete  temperature  at any  location  within  the mass  to  exceed 155\u00b0F at any point in time.  Failure to maintain a maximum peak concrete temperature less than or equal to 155\u00b0F will be cause for rejection of the concrete placement by the Engineer.  l.  Do not allow the temperature differential to exceed 35\u00b0F or the value of the variable limit (if approved) at any point in time.  Failure to control the maximum concrete temperature differential  to  less  than or  equal  to the specified  limit  may  be  cause for rejection  of  the concrete placement by the Engineer.  Exclude malfunctioning sensors from the differential calculation.  m.  Protect  the  placement  from  exposure  to  precipitation  to  prevent  cooling  of  the  surface.  Maintain the protection until temperature control is no longer required.  n.  Allow  the  forms  to  remain  in  place  until  the  estimated  strength  of  the  concrete  surface exceeds 2500 psi based on the lowest indicated maturity from the data loggers and until the  differential  between  the  mean  center  temperature  and  ambient  temperature  is  less than  30\u00b0F  and  decreasing.

Do  not  remove  forms  before  meeting  all  other  requirements  listed elsewhere in the Contract Documents.  o. Tenting, erecting windbreaks, covering with plastic, curing blankets, or other means may  be necessary to protect the concrete surface from rapid cooling after form removal.  p. Protect  concrete  surfaces  when  the  temperature  differential  between  the  peak  temperature and ambient temperature is greater than 30\u00b0F.  q. Allow  mass  concrete  temperature  control  procedures  to  remain  in  effect  until  the temperature differential between the average peak temperature and the three-day mean ambient low temperature is less than 35\u00b0F.  r. Ensure  that  mass  concrete  elements  exposed  to  water  reach  at  least  the  28-  day compressive  strength  as  indicated  by  the  approved  maturity  curve  and  has  a  peak temperature-to-water temperature differential less than 35\u00b0F before exposure.  s. Obtain written approval from the Engineer before removing temperature control.  Curing.  Meet  the  curing  requirements  of  Subsection  601.03.8  and  Subsection  808.03.9,  except  as follows.  Continuously  moist  cure  mass  concrete  placements  for  at  least  14  days  and  until  the  28-day compressive  strength  as  indicated  by  the  approved  maturity  curve  is  achieved.    Maintaining moisture on the top surface with forms in place shall be considered adequate moist curing.  If strength and thermal control are achieved before 14 days, forms may be removed but continue moist curing.  Ensure  that  water  used  for  curing  is  fresh  water  and  does  not  contain  any  salts  or  other components harmful to concrete.  Control the temperature of water used for moist curing to within 30\u00b0F of the peak concrete temperature.  Temperature Control Failure.  Failure to meet the temperature control requirements may be cause for rejection of the concrete. Halt subsequent mass concrete placements immediately.  Investigate the events that produced the failure, and submit a written report to the Engineer.  Ensure that the investigation includes a thorough examination of the concrete placement and the reasons for non-compliance with these requirements, and document the width and extent of all visible cracks (if any) after cleaning the surface to fully expose them.  Measure surface crack intensity after monitoring shows that the temperature, as measured by all sensors near the concrete surface, has dropped to within 10\u00b0F of the concrete temperature, as measured by the sensors at the center of thermal mass.  Ensure that a licensed Rhode Island Professional Engineer conducts the investigation, and present crack repair options for approval by the Engineer according to Subsection 607.03.2.4.  Remove all equipment and materials from the mass concrete element and clean the surface for the  Engineer  to  verify  the  measurements  of  the  crack  intensity.    Provide  safe  access  for  the Engineer\u2019s inspection.

Ensure  that  the  engineering  layout,  whether  furnished  by  the  Department  or  the  Contractor, includes offset staking for the proposed trench every 50 ft or less from structure to structure.  Field conditions may require exceptions for the distance between stakes.  Mark stakes with stationing on the pipe line side of the stake parallel to the installation, offset distance on the side opposite the pipe line, and depth of cut marked on the side facing the open trench.  Transfer this information to transverse batter boards every 50 ft with line and grade clearly marked and the target set.  The Contractor, at its option, may perform pipe layout using the laser beam method.  When site conditions preclude the use of traditional survey methods, use the laser beam method.  Grade, for the purpose of this Section, is defined as the design invert elevation for all pipelines.  Trench Excavation.  Excavate trenches according to SECTION 205.  Bedding.  Ensure that pipe bedding conforms to one of the classes specified in Subsection 701.02.5.  Class A bedding consists of a continuous concrete cradle.  Shape Class B and Class C bedding to fit the bell of the pipe to the height specified.  Install the pipe in compacted bedding material at least 12 in. in thickness and pre-shaped to accommodate  700-2  SECTION 701 \u2014 PIPE CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS         Part 700 \u2014 Drainage and Selected Utility Accessories  December 2022  the bell of the pipe.  After the pipe has been installed, backfill the trench and compact with bedding material to a height equal to at least one-half the diameter of the pipe.  Laying Pipe.  Begin the pipe laying at the downstream end of the pipe line.  Place the bell or groove ends of pipe facing upstream to allow for proper overlap of the pipe seams.  Place flexible pipe with the longitudinal laps or seams at the sides.  Lay paved or partially lined pipe so that the longitudinal centerline of the paved segment coincides with the flow line.  When elliptical pipe with circular reinforcement or circular pipe with elliptical reinforcement is used, install the pipe so that the manufacturer\u2019s marks designating top and bottom of the pipe are not more than 5 degrees from the vertical plane through the longitudinal axis of the pipe.  Ensure that pipe is properly secured and covered when using flowable fill or in areas of stormwater storage to avoid pipes rising or lifting.  Joining Pipe.  Rigid pipe may be a bell and spigot or tongue and groove design unless one type is specified. Use a method of joining pipe sections so that the ends are fully entered and the inner surfaces are reasonably flush and even.  Use mortar joints that have an excess of mortar to form a bead around the outside of the pipe and that is finished smooth on the inside to the spring line of pipe larger than 30 in.  For grouted joints, use  molds  or runners  to  retain  the  poured  grout.    Install  rubber  ring  gaskets to  form  a  flexible watertight seal.  Install  reinforced  concrete  pipe  36  in.  or  greater  in  diameter  with  both  rubber  gaskets  and  a Portland cement mortar joint.  When Portland cement mixtures are used, protect the completed joints against rapid drying by suitable cover material.  Join ductile iron pipe according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.  Join  plastic  pipe  by  plastic  sleeve  couplings,  welded  to  the  pipe  by  applying  an  appropriate adhesive as recommended by the manufacturer.  Inspect pipe before any backfill is placed.  For any pipe determined by the Engineer to be out of alignment,  unduly  settled,  or  damaged, remove the  pipe  and re-lay  or  replace  at  no  additional cost to the Department.  Smooth Interior Corrugated Polyethylene Pipe and Smooth Interior Corrugated  Polypropylene Pipe.  The following additional requirements apply to these classifications of pipe.  SECTION 701 \u2014 PIPE CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS  700-3      Part 700 \u2014 Drainage and Selected Utility Accessories  December 2022  a.  Limitation of Use.  Only use polyethylene and polypropylene pipe where the top of the pipe  is at least 3 ft below the finished grade.  b.  Bedding.  Ensure that the bedding for pipe diameters less than or equal to 24 in. is Class B  or  Class  C  as  defined  in  Subsection  701.02.5,  except  ensure  that  Class  B  has  100 percent pass the 3-in. sieve.  The Engineer will approve the choice of material in writing.  Ensure  that  the  bedding  for  pipe  diameters  greater  than  24  in.  is  excavatable  Class  I controlled low strength material (CLSM), as defined in Subsection 603.01.1.  c.  Trench  Excavation  and  Backfill.  Ensure  that  trench  excavation  conforms  to  SECTION 205.  \u25cf  Where  the  Engineer  determines  that  the  excavation  is  in  an  area  with  a  high  water table, place a separation filter fabric that complies with Subsection M20.01 against the  bottom  and  sides  of  the  excavation  to  completely  enclose  the  pipe  embedment material, with a minimum 12-in. overlap to a minimum height of 12 in. above the top of the pipe.  After the Class C pipe embedment material is placed and compacted, lap the filter fabric to enclose the material.  \u25cf  Excavate the trench to a minimum depth of 4 in. below the specified bottom invert of the pipe in soil trenches and 6 in. in rock trenches.  Place and compact bedding to a height of 1 in. above the specified bottom invert of the pipe.  Shape the surface of the bedding to fit the contour of the pipe.  Install the pipe and support or constrain the pipe to prevent its movement as the trench is filled and the material compacted.  Place and compact  bedding  material  simultaneously  on  both  sides  of  the  pipe  within  the  pipe zone.  Use hand tamping as needed to fill and compact the haunch zone of the pipe. Ensure that the placement and compaction occur simultaneously on both sides of the pipe to prevent damage to or movement of the pipe.  Place the bedding material in 6- in. compacted lifts to a minimum of 12 in. above the top of the pipe (initial backfill). Place the final backfill in lifts no greater than 6 in. after compaction.  \u25cf  With  the  approval  of  in Subsection 603.01.1, may be used as pipe embedment and for the remaining backfill.  the  Engineer,  CLSM,  Classification  I,  as  defined  d.  Testing.  No sooner than 30 days after the completion of the compaction of the backfill, conduct  mandrel  testing  or  hand  measurements  of  the  pipe  under  the  direction  of  the Engineer.  Testing may be required for up to 25 percent of the total length of pipe.  The Engineer will determine the actual sections of pipe to be tested.  Conduct mandrel testing for pipe diameters of 24 in. or less.  Ensure that the mandrel is rigid steel, with a pulling ring at each end, an odd number of legs (nine legs minimum), and an effective diameter at least 95 percent of the base inside diameter.  The base inside diameter is the nominal pipe size less a 1.5-percent fabrication tolerance.  Remove any pipe through which the mandrel fails to pass, and replace the pipe.  Conduct mandrel testing or hand measurements for diameters greater than 24 in. up to and including 36-in. diameter pipe.  700-4  SECTION 701 \u2014 PIPE CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS    Part 700 \u2014 Drainage and Selected Utility Accessories  December 2022  Conduct hand measurements of deflection for pipe diameters greater than 36 in. every 5 linear  feet  of  a  selected  length  of  pipe.    The  following  Table  presents  the  minimum diameter measurements, which are based on a 5-percent maximum deflection and a 1.5- percent manufacturer\u2019s fabrication tolerance.  Nominal Pipe Diameter  Allowable Deflected Diameter  27 in. 30 in.  36 in. 42 in. 48 in. 54 in. 60 in.  25.26 in. 28.07 in.  33.69 in. 39.30 in. 44.92 in. 50.53 in. 56.15 in.  Removed pipe may be reused as the replacement pipe only if approved by the Engineer. Otherwise,  remove  the  damaged  pipe  from  the  work  site.    All  costs  associated  with mandrel or hand measurement testing, including the replacement of deflected pipe and any delays that are incurred, will be at no additional cost to the Department.  Backfilling.  After the pipe is installed, backfill the trench with material according to SECTION 205.  When  the  top  of  the  pipe  is  exposed  above  the  top  of  the  trench,  place  and  compact  the embankment material for a distance on each side of the pipe equal to at least twice the horizontal inside diameter of the pipe or 12 ft, whichever is less, and to a minimum height of 3 ft above the pipe.  Place and compact the material simultaneously on both sides of the pipe for the full width of the roadbed according to SECTION 205.  Do not allow construction traffic over the pipe until 3 ft of compacted backfill is in place over the pipe.  Above this elevation, place and compact the embankment according to Subsection 202.03.2.  Replacement of Unsuitable Material.  When the Engineer determines that the material at the bottom of trenches is unsuitable for the support of drainage pipes, provide additional excavation.  Remove unsuitable material to a depth not to exceed 3 ft.  When the unsuitable material has been removed, level and refill the bottom of the excavation with the appropriate class of bedding.  Place  Class  B  bedding  in  8-in.  lifts,  and  compact  to  90  percent  of  its  maximum  dry  density according to Subsection 205.03.5.  Grade the final compacted lift in the replacement operation to the original design elevation of the bottom of trenches.  Unauthorized Excavation.  If the bottom of any trench has been excavated below the required grade indicated, restore the grade by refilling with a well-compacted bedding material.  SECTION 701 \u2014 PIPE CULVERTS AND STORM DRAINS  700-5       Part 700 \u2014 Drainage and Selected Utility Accessories  December 2022  No payment will be made for unauthorized excavation.  Furnish, place, and compact the bedding material to refill the trench to grade at no additional cost to the Department.  Drainage Structure Hood.  Perform the construction according to the manufacturer\u2019s requirements and with SECTIONS 701 and 702.  Use a hood that forms a baffle that prevents debris and reduces pollutants from flowing out of the catch basin.  Ensure that the drainage structure hood protrudes a minimum of 6 in. or one-third of the effluent pipe diameter below the invert.  Securely attach the hood to the catch basin and/or pipe, and seal the hood to the structure per the manufacturer\u2019s requirements.  Provide vent holes at the top of the hood to allow airflow.  Provide  Shop  Drawings,  computations,  and  any  necessary  documentation  for  the  drainage structure hoods.  Drainage structure hoods will be approved by the Engineer in writing 14 days before its delivery onsite.  701.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Pipe Culvert and Storm Drain.  Pipe  Culvert  and  Storm  Drain,  both  new  and  re-laid,  including  Smooth  Interior  Corrugated Polyethylene Pipe and Smooth Interior Corrugated Polypropylene Pipe, will be measured in linear feet of continuous runs of pipe installed.

When  specified,  before  being  driven  or  placed,  apply  a  protective coating in the shop to steel pipe piles, closure plates, and splices with zinc-silicate primer. When  specified,  after  piles  are  driven  and  all  bracing  members,  concrete  caps,  and encasements are in place, apply one complete field coating to all exposed steel.  c.  Drive Points, Drive Shoes, and Closure Plates.  When specified, fit steel pipe piles with closure plates and/or drive points.  Furnish closed-end steel pipe piles with flat closure plates of the required thickness and weight of steel.  When specified, provide end closure  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-13      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  plates  that  are  single-piece  cast  steel,  60-degree  conical  points  (ASTM  A27),  with  an external flange.  When specified, furnish open-end or closed-end steel pipe piles with one-piece, cast steel (ASTM  A27)  drive  shoes,  provided  with  a  thickened  ridge  along  the  bearing  surface between the pile tip and the shoe.  Ensure that shoe flanges are external and are of the required dimensions and weight of steel.  Ensure that plates, drive points, and shoes provide full bearing with pile tips and are affixed to the piles using 5/16-in. continuous fillet welds along the flange or ridge contact with the pile tips.  d.  Cleanout  and  Dewatering.    Clean  out  steel  pipe  piles  that  are  driven  open-ended  to remove accumulated soil materials and then dewater the pile.  Use methods to remove the soil materials from the interior of the pile that do not result in damage to the driven pipe pile.  Contain and separate soil cuttings and accumulated water.  Properly dispose of water and accumulated soil cuttings.  e.  Inspection of Driven Pipe Piles.  Provide access and facilities for the Engineer to inspect the interior of each driven pipe pile.  The Engineer will not accept any driven steel pipe pile  unless  inspected  and  approved  by  the  Engineer  as  described  in  Subsection",
            "804.03.4": " 804.03.4(d).    Correct  or  replace  improperly  driven,  damaged,  or  defective  piles  at  no additional cost to the Department.  f.  Placement  of  Concrete  and  Steel  Reinforcement.    Where  driven  steel  pipe  piles  are concrete-filled and no interior steel reinforcement will be installed except within 5 ft of the cut-off  elevation,  place  the  concrete  in  one  continuous  operation  with  the  concrete installed from the lowest point of the pile by tremie.  Do not allow the concrete to free fall. Use vibration or rodding only to a depth of 5 ft below the design cut-off elevation.  Use the class of concrete as specified in Subsection M07.10.2.  For all steel pipe piles at each structure footing or within the required radius, drive, clean out, and inspect before placement of concrete.  Alternatively, if approved by the Engineer, discontinue all driving within the specified limits until concrete in the last pile driven has attained its 28-day compressive strength.  g.  Holes in Piling.  Pile segments with one drilled hole with a diameter of \u215e in. or less in any cross section may be incorporated into the finished structure.  Cut off pile segments with more than one hole in the cross section, flame cut hole(s), or a hole greater than \u215e in. to remove the hole(s).  This requirement does not apply to holes drilled for attaching dynamic testing  equipment,  holes  shown  in  the  Contract,  or  holes  within  12  in.  of  the  cutoff elevation.  Steel H-Section Piles.  a.  Dimensions  and  Section  Thicknesses.    Where  practical,  furnish  steel  H-sections  in  full  lengths.  800-14  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  b.  Drive  Points.    Fit  H-section  piles  with  drive  points  that  are  cast  in  one-piece  steel conforming to ASTM A27 Grade 65-35.  Ensure that the drive points have sufficient flange and continuous web vertical backups to provide proper alignment and a secure fit with the pile.  Flange surfaces to bear on rock or in soil may be horizontal or sloped (minimum 15 degrees  to  maximum  30  degrees)  and  may  be  provided  with  individual  or  continuous cutting teeth.  c.  Protective Coating.  Where specified, provide steel H-section piles with a shop application of  one  coat  of  zinc-oxide  primer.    Additionally,  apply  one  or  more  field-applied  surface coats to exposed sections of piles as driven.  Do not apply field coats to lengths of pile to be concrete encased.  d.  Concrete  Encasement.    Where  specified,  encase  exposed  lengths  of  driven  steel  H- section  piles  in  concrete.    Furnish  and  place  concrete  encasements  according  to SECTIONS 601 and 808.  e.  Holes in Piling.  Pile segments with one drilled hole with a diameter of \u215e in. or less in any cross section may be incorporated into the finished structure.  Cut off pile segments with more than one hole in the cross section, flame cut hole(s), or a hole greater than \u215e in. to remove the hole(s).  This requirement does not apply to holes drilled for attaching dynamic testing  equipment,  holes  shown  in  the  Contract,  or  holes  within  12  in.  of  the  cutoff elevation.  Splices and Splicing Piles.  a.  General.  Where splicing is permitted, ensure that the splice develops the full strength of the  unspliced  pile.    Only  one  splice  may  be  used  throughout  the  pile  length  unless specifically approved by the Engineer.  Ensure that splices are fabricated and installed as shown on the Plans.  Ensure that any alternative method of splicing or commercial splice proposed for use provides equal results and has been approved by the Engineer before use.  b.  Steel Pipe, Steel Casing, and H-Section Piles.  Where practical, use full length piles.  Use full penetration electric arc welding for splices.  Use proprietary or other fabricated steel splicers that match the grade of the piles being spliced and that develop the full strength of  the  unspliced  pile.    The  Engineer  will  approve  the  splices  before  use.    Chamfer  the flanges of fabricated splicers to enable effective welding.  Before splicing, cut off the top of any pile that is bent, deformed, or twisted by driving or trueing up to normal with the axis of the pile before placing the next pile section.  Ensure that  the  end  surfaces  of  piles  provide full  bearing  with the  next  pile  section  or  splicers. Ensure that axes of all spliced sections are in a straight alignment.  Provide flanges of H-section piles that are either spliced by butt welding or with plates that are welded or bolted.  Prefabricated splicers may be used if the splice can develop the net section of the pile in compression, tension, shear, and bending.  Splice pipe piles either by butt welding or using welded sleeves.  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-15      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Ensure that the surfaces to be welded are smooth, uniform, and free from loose scale, slag, grease, or other material that could prevent proper welding.  Steel may be oxygen cut.  Carbon-arc gouging, chipping, or grinding may be used for joint preparation.  Welding  is  permitted  for  splicing  steel  casings.    Use  welding  for  splicing  steel  piles, attaching pile points, and attaching bracing or other steel members to steel piles.  Ensure that all welding and qualifications for welders conforms to Subsection 824.03.6.  c.  Precast/Prestressed  Concrete  Piles.    Do  not  splice  precast/prestressed  concrete  piles except  to  produce  short  extensions  as  permitted  herein.    Dowels  or  other  mechanical splices  must  be  approved  by  the  Engineer  before  incorporation  into  the  work.    Design splices to develop the full axial and moment capacity of the unspliced cross section.  Determination of Bearing Capacity.  a.  General.  Drive piles to the required bearing capacity.  b.  Wave Equation Analysis.  For design loads less than or equal to 50 tons, a Rhode Island Registered  Professional  Engineer  shall  prepare a  wave  equation  analysis  to  determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles.  The Contractor shall be responsible for retaining a  Professional  Engineer  registered  in  the  State  of  Rhode  Island  to  perform  the  wave equation analysis.  Submit the results of the analysis, driving system specifications and data, and the proposed driving criteria to the Engineer for written approval.  Perform a separate wave equation analysis for each design pile type, load, and length, and for each driving system proposed for use.  Ensure that the analysis accounts for the proposed hammer assembly, pile cap, blocks, cushion characteristics, pile properties and estimated  lengths,  and  anticipated  soil  properties.    Use  the  pile  driving  equipment properties  as  recommended  or  provided  by  the  manufacturer.    Ensure  that  the  design bearing  capacity  of  a  pile  is  0.364  of  the  calculated  ultimate  bearing  capacity  as determined by a wave equation analysis alone.  The analysis may, at the discretion of the Engineer, be used to establish design capacities of greater than 50 tons if similar piles have been installed in similar soil conditions in close proximity to the site.  c.  Wave  Equation  Analysis  Calibrated  with  Dynamic  Pile  Tests.    Submit  for  review  and approval  by  the  Engineer  a  wave  equation  analysis  (WEAP)  for  each  pile  that will  be installed.  Ensure that the analysis demonstrates that the driving forces developed by  the pile  hammer  equipment  and  driving  methods  will  not  overstress the pile section and any splices.  The  Contractor\u2019s Engineer or testing consultant shall supply all equipment, including the Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA), and  perform the  dynamic  pile  analyses  during  the  driving of  the  indicator piles.  Within three days of completion of the dynamic testing, submit the results of the field data for review and approval by the Engineer.  Furnish  the  electrical  power  required  for  dynamic  testing  of  the  piles.    Equip  field generators  with  functioning  meters  for  monitoring  voltage  and  frequency.    Provide  a temporary  shelter  of  adequate  size  to  protect  the  dynamic  test  equipment  from the elements.  800-16  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  General  Procedures.  \u25cb  Before Driving.   Provide equipment, personnel,  or labor as required to perforate the  pile  and  attach  and  remove  the  PDA  transducers  to  and  from  the  pile  as directed  by  the  Engineer.    Provide a man-lift or other suitable equipment for the Engineer to access the PDA instrumentation during driving.  Attach a minimum of four strain and acceleration transducers (two each  minimum)  to  the  pile  at  the locations  specified  or  directed  by the  Engineer.    The  Contractor\u2019s  Engineer will provide the transducers.  Locate  the  transducers  at  equal radial  or  cross-sectional  distances  on diametrically  opposite  sides  of  the  piles.    Locate the transducers at  the  same axial distance from the top of the pile, and attach them at least 1\u00bd pile diameters below the top of the pile but no  closer than 2 ft below the lowest point of the pile hammer and sleeve.    Relocate the transducers satisfying these conditions before driving each new pile section.  Ensure that the  transducers  remain  above  water level  during  installation and  driving.    Align  and  protect  the  transmission  cables to  suit  the  Contractor\u2019s  method  of  operation  but  maintain  the  operation  of  the equipment during driving.  Position  and  align  the  pile  so  that  the  hammer  impact  is  applied  axially  and concentrically with the pile.  \u25cb  Driving.   Drive  the  piles  to  the  tip  elevation  or  deeper  to  a  driving  resistance determined  by the  WEAP  analysis  and  as  confirmed  by  PDA  measurements on  the  indicator  piles.  Within each substructure unit, drive the indicator piles first.  Drive and restrike  all indicator  piles  within  a  given  substructure unit  shown  on  the  Contract  Drawings with  monitoring  by  PDA before  the Engineer  establishes  the  final  tip  elevations for  friction  piles  or  driving  resistance  for  end-bearing  piles  for  the  remaining non-indicator piles within the substructure unit.  In the Contractor\u2019s schedule, allow time for a two-day evaluation at each substructure unit by the  Engineer following the end of restrikes on the indicator piles at each  substructure unit  so  that  the Engineer  can  establish  final  criteria  for  the  remaining  production  piles.  While waiting  for  restrike  of  the  indicator  piles,  the  Contractor  may  begin  installation of  other  non-indicator  piles;  do  not  drive  to  completion  any  non-indicator  piles before  the  Engineer  establishes  the  final  tip  elevation  or  driving  resistance.  Where friction  piles are used, drive  the  indicator  piles  to  the required  design  tip elevation  and  to  the  required  resistance  as  measured  by  dynamic  monitoring. Drive  the  indicator  piles  deeper  than  the  design  tip  elevations  to  meet  the required  resistance,  if  necessary.    The  Engineer  will  determine  the  final  tip elevations for the remaining non-indicator piles at each substructure unit following the  indicator  pile  installation  and  restrike  and  analysis  of  the  PDA  results performed  on  the  indicator piles.  At  the  substructure  units  supported  by  end-bearing  piles,  initially  drive  the indicator piles to  a  penetration  resistance  expressed  as  a  minimum  number  of blows  per  inch  for  six  successive  inches  as  determined  by  WEAP  or  other  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-17     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  alternatives.  Ensure that the  final  driving  of  the  indicator piles satisfies one of the two following criteria:  +  The  final  required penetration resistance determined by  dynamic monitoring  (PDA)  +  To  refusal  (defined  as  > 20  blows  with  less  than  1  in.  of penetration)  Drive the remaining end-bearing production piles to the minimum tip elevation and to  whichever of the following criteria is satisfied first:  +  The  required  penetration  resistance  as  determined  by  the  Engineer  after driving the indicator piles and analyses of the PDA results of the indicator piles  +  The pile has refused (defined as > 20 blows with less than 1 in. of penetration)  Adjust the driving energy to maintain acceptable stresses in the pile, and realign the  driving  system  if  the  testing  equipment  indicates  that  the  hammer impact is not delivered axially to the pile.  Monitor and record:  +  Ram travel length  +  Bounce  chamber  pressure  and/or  steam  or  air  pressure  at  the  inlet  to  the  hammer as appropriate for the driving system used  +  Blow counts for specific intervals of penetration during driving of piles  +  Complete the restrike driving of the indicator piles.  During restrike operations, the Engineer will perform PDA monitoring.  During restrike, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to apply individual hammer blows to the pile to provide for dynamic records and analyses.  Before restriking, wait a minimum of three days after the end of the initial driving.  The Engineer will determine the amount of penetration during restrike not to exceed 1 ft.  d.  Static Pile Load Tests.  When the design capacity of piles is greater than 50 tons, establish the driving criteria and ultimate load capacity for each pile type and capacity following the procedures in ASTM D1143, \u201cPiles Under Static Axial Compressive Load,\u201d using 1) the quick load compression test, except take the test to failure as described below, or 2) three times the design load, or 3) 1000 tons, whichever first occurs.  Use testing equipment and measuring  systems  that  conform  to  ASTM  D1143.    Install  telltales  and/or  elastic  strain gauges, appropriately sheathed, in or along piles at the intervals specified, and monitor vertical  movements  or  incremental  strain  measurements.    Use  calibrated  dial  gauges capable of reading increments of 0.001 in. to monitor relative movements or strains at the pile tip, head, or specified interval along the pile length.  Submit for the Engineer\u2019s approval a wave equation analysis for each type and capacity of pile to be tested and detailed plans of the proposed pile load test apparatus, including:  \u25cf  Load frame and reference members \u25cf  Load cell or jacking apparatus  800-18  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Reaction system \u25cf  Proposed method and intervals for telltale installation and protection  A  Rhode  Island  Registered  Professional  Engineer,  retained  or  employed  by  the Contractor, shall prepare the wave equation analysis and pile load test plans.  Design and construct  the  load  test  apparatus  to  allow  the  various  load  increments  to  be  placed gradually without causing vibration to the pile.  Ensure that the wave equation analysis demonstrates that the piles will not be damaged during driving, and determine the blow count  necessary  to  achieve  the  required  ultimate  static  capacities.    The  Engineer  will review and approve in writing the proposed driving criteria.  The design bearing capacity is defined as 50 percent of the failure load.  The failure load of a pile under axial compressive load is that load that produces a settlement of the pile head at failure equal to:  Sf   =   S + (0.15 + 0.008D)  Where:  Sf   =  Settlement at failure, inches D   =   Pile diameter or width, inches S    =  Elastic deformation of total unsupported pile length, inches  Furnish piles to be used for load tests with telltales and protective sleeves incorporated into or along the length of the pile.  Submit the proposed telltale design and method of installation  to the  Engineer  for  written  approval before the manufacture or  furnishing  of piles.  Ensure that the telltales are sleeved and protected during driving and are functional throughout the pile load test.  Secure the sleeves and cast them in the interior of precast or cast-in-place concrete piles, secured to the interior walls of steel pipe piles, or affixed to  the  faces  of  steel  pipe,  timber,  and  precast  piles  or  the  web  of  H-section  piles  as required.  For the telltales, provide solid, flush-joint sections of steel rods that extend to and screw into threaded steel mounts affixed to or cast into the pile at the specified points along the pile  length.    For  the  telltale  sleeves,  use  plastic  or  steel  tubing  as  specified,  which  are properly aligned, installed, and affixed to the screw mounts so that the telltale rods can be lowered  into  the  sleeves  entirely  under  their  own  weight.    Where  permitted  by  the dimensions of the test pile, the Contractor may choose to protect the tubes by installing them inside steel or PVC pipe.  Provide sleeves and rods with end caps that provide protection during pile driving.  Before installation of the telltale rods, fill the sleeves with a sufficient quantity of oil or grease to fully occupy the annular space between the sleeve and the rod.  Install telltale rods into sleeves  under  the  inspection  of the  Engineer.   For  any  telltale  rod  installed  without  the Engineer\u2019s inspection, remove, measure, and re-insert the rod under the inspection of the Engineer.  Drive load test piles to the minimum tip elevations and at the driving criteria determined based upon the wave equation analysis.  Determine the elevation of the top of the test pile immediately  after  driving,  after  driving  anchor  piles,  and  just  before  load  testing  to  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-19       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  determine heave.  Redrive or jack any test pile that has heaved more than \u00bc in. to the original  tip  elevation  before  load  testing.   Observe  a minimum  three-day  waiting  period between the driving of any anchor piles or the load test pile and the initiation of the pile load test.  Prevent eccentric loading of the pile.  If the test fails due to eccentric loading, no payment will be made for the test and no future test will be performed on the eccentrically loaded pile.  When the approved test method requires the use of tension (anchor) piles that will later be used as permanent piles in the work, use the tension piles that are the same type and diameter  as  the  production  piles  and  are  driven  in  the  location  of  the  permanent  piles. Test piles must successfully test (i.e., did not fail during testing) to be used as permanent piles.  Do not incorporate test anchor piles into the permanent work should a failure of the test occur.  Perform the Boot Strap method by jacking down on the test pile or piles with a calibrated hydraulic jack placed beneath a girder.  Anchor the girder to tension piles located at least 6 ft from the test pile or piles.  Do not allow piles to be closer than 6 ft from the test pile or allow piles to be used to assist in anchoring the girder.  Ensure that connections of the girder to the anchors and hydraulic jack are tight when the test is initiated, and ensure that the jack can move the test pile or piles a vertical distance of at least 5 in. during the test.  If the load is applied to the test pile or piles by jacking against a dead load, do not provide supports to this dead load that are closer than 6 ft from the test pile or piles.  Ensure that the jack can move the test pile or piles a vertical distance of 5 in.  Always provide a qualified employee to be present during the performance of the test to maintain the required load.  If the test is stopped before completion and the load is entirely or partially removed from the pile or piles due to defects in the jack, yield of connections, insufficient  load  or  travel  capacity  of  the  jack,  or  for  other  mechanical  reasons,  the Engineer  will  order  that  the  load  test  be  abandoned  and  replaced  by  a  new  test  to  be conducted on another pile or piles at an adjacent location.  Pile Driving Equipment.  a.  Submittals.    Submit  a  description  of  the  proposed  equipment,  including  hammers  and appurtenances, according to Subsection 105.02 before starting work.  When the bearing capacity  of  piles  will  be  determined  by  a  wave  equation  analysis,  submit  calculations based  on  the  wave  equation  analysis  (WEAP  or  other  equivalent  analysis)  that demonstrate  that  the  piles  can  be  driven  to  the  required  length  with  a  driving  energy without  damage  to  the  piles.    The  required  number  of  hammer  blows  to  achieve  pile capacity shall be between 4 and 10 blows per inch for the equipment to be considered acceptable for the pile installation.  The required number of hammer blows indicated by the calculations for the required bearing capacity shall be between 4 and 10 blows per inch for the equipment to be considered acceptable.  In  addition,  acceptable  driving  equipment  requires  that  calculated  pile  stresses corresponding  to  the  driving  criteria  and  required  pile  capacity  are  less  than  the  stress  800-20  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  level that will result in damage to the pile.  For steel piles, compressive driving stresses must not exceed 90 percent of the yield point (0.9 Fy) of the pile.  For concrete piles, tensile stresses  must  not  exceed  three  times  the  square  root  of  the  concrete  compressive strength,  f\u2032c,  of  the  pile  plus  the  effective  prestress  value;  i.e.,  [3  x  (f\u2032c)\u00bd  +  prestress]. Compressive  stresses  in  concrete  piles  cannot  exceed  85  percent  of  the  concrete compressive strength minus the effective prestress (0.85 f\u2032c \u2013 prestress).  For timber piles, compressive stresses must not exceed three times the allowable static design strength.  In-water or near-water pile driving locations, comply with the most recent soft-start State and Federal programmatic and consultation requirements.  Before  any  change  in  the  driving  system  or  equipment  will  be  considered,  submit  the revised pile driving equipment data and calculations for corresponding driving criteria and pile stresses.  The  Engineer\u2019s  written  approval  of  the  pile  driving  equipment  does  not  relieve  the Contractor of its responsibility to drive piles, free of damage, to the required bearing and tip elevations.  b.  Hammers.  Piles may be driven with drop hammers, single-, double- or differential-action  compressed air or steam operated hammers, or diesel or hydraulic hammers.  \u25cf  Gravity or Drop Hammers.  Gravity or drop hammers may be used for driving timber piles, but do use gravity hammers for precast concrete piles or for piles with design capacities greater than 30 tons.  When gravity hammers are allowed, ensure that the ram weight is at least equivalent to the combined weight of the drive cap and the pile. Ensure that the ram weight is less than 3000 lb and that the fall height does not exceed 12 ft.  Equip all drop hammers with hammer guides to ensure concentric impact on the drive head or pile cushion.  \u25cf  Hydraulic Hammers.  Use a power plant having sufficient capacity to maintain, under working  conditions, the volume  and  pressure  specified  by  the  manufacturer.    Equip the  power  plant  and  equipment  with  accurate  pressure  gauges  that  are  easily accessible to the Engineer.  \u25cf  Diesel Hammers.  Equip open-end (single-acting), diesel hammers with a device to permit  the  Engineer  to  determine  hammer  stroke  at  all  times  during  pile  driving operations.   Submit  a  copy  of the manufacturer\u2019s  chart  that  equates  the stroke  and blows per minute.  Equip closed-end (double-acting), diesel hammers with a bounce chamber pressure gauge that is easily read from ground level.  Provide a correlation chart of bounce chamber pressure and delivered hammer energy.  \u25cf  Vibratory Pile Drivers.  Vibratory pile drivers may be used, subject to the Engineer\u2019s approval, provided that sufficient correlated data is developed and furnished to permit a  satisfactory  evaluation  of  pile  load-carrying  capacity  and  performance.    Establish these characteristics by direct comparison to the penetration and performance of the same  type(s)  of  pile,  driven  with  conventional  impact  hammers  under  similar conditions and in corresponding locations.  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-21     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  If a vibratory hammer is used, redrive each pile for a minimum of two pile diameters with an impact hammer that has the energy to verify the required bearing resistance during driving.  Delays and additional costs resulting from load tests or other extra work required to verify approval of the vibratory hammer or driving aids are at no additional cost to the Department.  Drive  a  number  of  length-determination  piles  as  ordered  by  the  Engineer  using  a conventional hammer to determine with reasonable accuracy the depth of acceptable penetration  throughout  the  area  of  each  foundation  or  trestle  bent.    Drive  the subsequent piles using the accepted alternative method to the corresponding depths of penetration with minor adjustments if driving conditions change.  Load test a representative number of such piles as designated by the Engineer and indicated on the Project Plans to the required capacity, plus a corresponding number of  those  piles  driven  using  the  alternative  method  and  equipment.    Record  and correlate load test data.  Perform a sufficient number of load tests on piles driven using the alternative method as required to verify the results and ensure design capacity.  No payments will be made to the Contractor for pile load tests in excess of those that would be required for piles driven by conventional methods, unless field conditions are such that the alternative methods must be used to advance piles.  In these cases, the additional  load  tests  will  be  measured  for  payment  if  the  Engineer  has  ordered  the tests in writing, and the tests are completed.  Driving Appurtenances.  a.  Hammer  Cushions.   Equip  all  impact  driving  equipment  except  gravity  hammers  with  a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the pile or hammer and to ensure uniform driving behavior.  Place a striker plate on the hammer cushion to ensure uniform compression of the cushion material.  b.  Pile Drive Head.  Fit piles driven with impact hammers with an adequate drive head to distribute the hammer blow to the pile head.  Ensure that the drive head is axially aligned with the hammer and pile.  Ensure that the drive head is guided by leads, and do not allow the head to be free swinging.  Fit the drive head around the pile to prevent the transfer of torsional forces during driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.  c.  Pile  Cushion.    Protect  concrete  piles  with  a  pile  cushion  that  ensures  that  the  hammer  energy is uniformly distributed to the pile head.  d.  Leads.  Use pile driving leads throughout the pile driving operation, and support the pile and hammer in proper positions.  Construct leads that affords freedom of movement of the  hammer  while  maintaining  alignment  of  the  hammer  and  pile  to  ensure  concentric impact for each blow.  Ensure that the leads have sufficient length to negate the need for a follower, and design the leads to permit proper alignment of batter piles.  e.  Followers.  Do not use followers.  800-22  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Preparation for Driving.  a.  Preconstruction  Survey  and  Vibration  Monitoring.  A  Rhode  Island  Registered Professional  Engineer,  employed  or  retained  by  the  Contractor  and  submitted  to  the Engineer before beginning work, shall perform a preconstruction survey of any structure within 200 ft of pile driving.  Ensure that the survey documents the existing preconstruction condition  of  structures  so  that  potential  impacts  due  to  pile  driving  can  be  assessed. Comply with SECTION 841.  During  pile  driving,  monitor  vibrations  at  structures  within  200  ft  of  pile  driving  using  a seismograph capable of measuring vibration accelerations, velocities, and amplitudes in three  mutually  perpendicular  directions.    A  Rhode  Island  Registered  Professional Engineer  shall  supervise  the  vibration  monitoring.    Adjust  the  pile  driving  operations  to limit construction vibration peak particle velocities to 1 in. per second, unless a lower limit is  warranted  based  on  the  preconstruction  survey.    Submit  daily  summaries  of  peak particle velocities and vibration records to the Engineer on a weekly basis.  b.  Layout and Elevation and Location Control.  Perform the layout of all pile locations using offsets from the Project baselines.  Establish ground surface elevations at the proposed driving locations to the nearest 0.1 ft, referenced to the Project elevation datum.  Set tide boards as required when driving piles on water.  Determine mudline elevations at each pile location on water before initiating driving.  Verify the tip elevation of driven piles to the nearest 0.01 ft relative to the Project elevation datum.    Where  foundation  or  trestle  piles  are  driven  in  groups,  or  where  piles  will  be restruck,  check  each  pile  tip  elevation  before  and  after  restriking  as  required  by  the Engineer.  c.  Excavations and Sheeting.  In general, do not drive piles until after the excavations are completed.  Restore any material forced up between or around piles resulting from driving to the correct elevation.  Compact the surface before any foundation concrete is placed.  Where sheeting or cofferdams will be constructed, and where piles will be driven within sheeting  alignments,  submit  the  proposed  sequence  of  operations  for  the  Engineer\u2019s written  approval  before  beginning  any  driving  of  sheeting  or  piles.    Ensure  that  the sheeting  installation  does  not  interfere  with,  obstruct,  damage,  or  otherwise  impact  the function of bearing piles.  d.  Preboring.  When required, prebore holes at pile locations to the required depths.  Ensure that prebored holes are generally smaller in diameter than the diameter or diagonal of the cross section of the pile, except where preboring is specified where driving vibrations are not permissible.  Ensure that preboring has sufficient depth to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth.  If subsurface obstructions are encountered, the hole diameter may be  increased  to  the  least  dimension  that  is  adequate  for  pile  installation.    Fill  any  void space remaining around the pile after completion of driving or other installation with sand or other approved material.  Do not use spuds to make a hole for inserting a pile in lieu of preboring.  Drive  piles  to  be  driven  through  newly  constructed  embankments  in  holes  drilled  or spudded  through  the  embankment  when  the  embankment  is  more  than  5  ft  in  height.  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-23     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Ensure that the hole has a diameter of not less than the greatest dimension of the pile cross section plus 6 in.  After driving the pile, fill the space around the pile to the surface of the embankment with dry sand or fine gravel.  Properly dispose of material resulting from drilling holes.  e.  Templates and Support Spuds.  Furnish and fabricate the templates as deemed necessary to align and maintain piles at their proper location, alignment, or batter throughout driving. Securely affix these templates using temporary spud piles or other appropriate bracing. Situate template configurations and support piles to not damage or displace driven piles nor interfere with pile driving or other portions of the work.  Maintain templates in place after  initial  driving  and  until  restriking  has  been  completed.    Dismantle  and  remove templates  and  temporary  supports  or  piles  to  not  damage  or  misalign  the  completed production piling.  f.  Measurement and Marking of Piles.  Measure the total length of each pile to be driven, and  mark  each  pile  in  the  increments  using  the  required  marking  material.    Notify  the Engineer of the total measured length of each pile, and allow the Engineer time to verify the length and to approve the pile marking before placing piles in the leads for driving.  During driving, provide markings on the leads or provide a graduated gauge that is clearly marked and situated at ground level to allow verification of the final driving resistance for each pile driven.  g.  Jetting.  Do not use water jetting unless specifically authorized in writing by the Engineer. Secure  any  necessary  permits  before  initiating  work.    When  water  jetting  is  used, determine the number of jets and volume and pressure at the jet nozzles that are sufficient to freely erode material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the final in-place pile.  Restore or repair all damage to the site resulting from jetting.  When jetting is specifically required, ensure that the plant has sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure of 100 lb/sq in. at two, \u00be-in. jet nozzles.  Cease jetting and remove the jets when the pile tip is at a minimum of 5 ft above the required tip elevation.  Drive the pile by impact  hammer  to  the  required  tip  elevation  and  bearing  capacity.    Control,  treat  as necessary, construct, and maintain appropriate settlement basins, and properly dispose of sediments and expended jetting water.  See SECTION 208 for specific guidance.  Driving Piles.  a.  Pile  Driving  Records.    Maintain  records  for  the  number  of  blows  required  for  each  pile driven for each foot of penetration for the entire pile and for the penetration under the final series of blows (blows per inch for a minimum of the last 12 in. of driving).  Ensure that the records include the type and size of hammer used, rate of hammer operation, and type and dimensions of driving helmet and cushion block.  Ensure that the records include the:  \u25cf  Date \u25cf  Starting time \u25cf  Total driving time \u25cf  Pile location and identification number \u25cf  Pile type and size  800-24  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Ground elevation from which the pile is driven \u25cf  Final elevation of the pile tip and butt  Ensure that the records also indicate the quantity of concrete that is placed in the pile.  b.  General.  Where underground utilities are located in the immediate vicinity, ensure that the first pile driven is the one nearest the utility.  If the Engineer agrees that an obstruction cannot be economically removed, the Contractor has the option of driving an alternative pile (or piles) at a location designated by the Engineer.  Remove or cut off the initial pile as directed by the Engineer.  c.  Driving Test Piles.  Drive preliminary test piles and piles designated for dynamic or static load  tests  at  the  locations  and  to  the  depths  directed  by  the  Engineer  before  other production piles are ordered or driven in the area represented by the test.  Drive all test piles with equipment identical to that which will be used for production piles.  Drive test piles to a hammer blow count determined by the WEAP Analysis and approved by  the  Engineer  at  the  estimated  tip  elevation.    Allow  test  piles  that  do  not  attain  the specified hammer blow count at a depth of 1 ft above the estimated tip elevation to set up for a period determined by the Engineer before being redriven.  If practical, warm up the hammer  before  redriving  begins  by  applying  at  least  20  blows  to  another  pile.    If  the specified hammer blow count is not attained upon redriving, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to drive a portion or all of the remaining pile length and repeat the set up and redrive procedure.  When ordered by the Engineer, drive test piles to plan tip elevation without attaining the required hammer blow count, and splice and drive until the required blow count is attained.  d.  Use of Preliminary Test Piles and Loaded Test Piles.  Loaded test piles may be used in the  permanent  structure  if  the  Engineer  determines  they  are  satisfactory  for  this  use. Preliminary  test  piles  driven  to  the  required  capacities  may  similarly  be  used  in  the permanent structure.  Remove loaded test piles or preliminary piles that are determined not suitable for use in the permanent structure, or cut off the piles a minimum of 2 ft below ground and below the base of footing or pile cap elevation.  e.  Penetration of Piles.  Drive all piles to a penetration so that the minimum pile tip elevation is attained and that the pile bearing value, determined as specified, is not less than that indicated in the Contract.  Drive  piles  located  offshore,  alongshore,  in  stream  beds,  or  along  stream  banks  to  the penetration as indicated on the Project Plans necessary for scour protection.  If, after a test pile or production pile is driven through and below a hard stratum, the bearing value of the pile drops below the required capacity, drive permanent piles through the hard stratum to the required capacity.  When production friction piles fail to achieve design bearing capacities after driving the full finished lengths, when approved by the Engineer, wait a minimum of 24 hours and then redrive one representative pile in each pile group to check the gain in bearing upon soil setup.    Determine  the  soil  setup  bearing  based  on  the  number  of  redriving  blows  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-25     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  necessary to drive the pile an additional 3 in.  These piles may be accepted without splicing if they exhibit the required bearing capacities upon redriving.  f.  Driven Pile Location and Alignment Tolerances.  Drive piles to within an axial tolerance not to exceed \u00bc in. per ft variation from the vertical or from the design batter orientation. Drive piles for trestle bents so that the bent cap may be constructed in its design location without inducing excessive stresses in the piles.  Ensure that the final position of the axial center of driven foundation piles, measured in the plane of the cut-off elevation, does not deviate from the design location by more than 6 in. or \u00bc of their diameter, whichever is greater, if all of the following criteria are met:  \u25cf  The average deviation along a line of piles in any direction within the bent does not  exceed 3 in. from the line through the required pile center locations.  \u25cf  The nearest edge of any pile is not closer than 9 in. from the design position of the  edge of footing or pile bent cap.  \u25cf  The minimum distance between the centers of any two adjacent piles is not less than  24 in. at the cut-off elevation.  \u25cf  The center of gravity of the pile group at any trestle bent or foundation, as calculated at the cut-off elevation, does not exceed the tolerances specified in the Contract for that pile group.  Considering  driven  pile  location  and  alignment  tolerances,  if  there  are  complications driving  a  pile  and  the  pile  alignment  tolerances  are  exceeded,  immediately  stop operations, and contact the Engineer to determine the appropriate course of action.  If the location of any pile exceeds these tolerances, then provide appropriate calculations to  show  the  center of  gravity  of the  pile  group  at  the  cut  off  elevation  as driven.    If  the center of gravity of any pile group exceeds the limits specified, or that otherwise presented in the Contract, submit a detailed remedy, including all relevant engineering calculations, for  review  and  approval  by  the  Engineer.    Perform  the  approved  corrective  action, including replacement of misaligned piles and/or furnishing materials and constructing any required increase in footing dimensions, at no additional cost to the Department.  Do  not  manipulate  piles  after  driving  attempting  to  force  the  pile  into  proper  position. Remove or, if space allows and as allowed by the Engineer, cut off misdriven piles and redrive, or replace mislocated piles to the satisfaction of the Engineer.  g.  Pile Heave and Restriking.  Determine the top elevation of each pile head immediately after driving and again after completion of the driving of all piles within any foundation or trestle pile group.  Redrive any pile that heaves more than \u00bc in. to the design tip elevation and to the required driving resistance.  For  concrete-filled  piles,  restrike  heaved  casings  or  steel  pipe  piles  before  placing concrete in any pile within that pile group that has not evidenced heave.  800-26  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Defective, Damaged, or Broken Piles.  Ensure  that  the  driving  operations  and  procedures  do  not  subject  piles  to  excessive  or  undue damage or stresses that produce:  \u2022  Spalling and crushing of concrete \u2022  Splitting, splintering, or brooming of timber piles \u2022  Splitting or excessive deformation of steel piles and casings \u2022  Bending, crushing, torsional rotations, etc. (especially for steel H-piles)  Correct any pile damaged by reason of internal defects, improper driving, driven out of position, or driven below the required butt elevation by one of the following methods as approved by the Engineer:  \u2022  Replace the pile with a new and, if necessary, longer pile.  \u2022  Cut-off the defective or low pile below the base-of-footing elevation, and drive a second  pile adjacent to the defective or low pile.  \u2022  Splice, or otherwise build up, the pile as provided for herein, or extend and reinforce the  footing sufficiently to properly embed the pile.  Perform all remedial materials and work at no additional expense to the Department.  Pile Dewatering, Cleanout, and Spoil/Water Containment and Disposal.  Remove soil materials, debris, and/or accumulated water from driven steel pipe piles and steel casing piles to allow inspection of pile interiors and before placement of any concrete.  Provide for the control, containment, separation of sediments, and proper disposal of sediments and water volumes removed from the piles.  Restore or repair any damage to the site incurred by dewatering and cleanout of piles according to the Contract requirements.  Pile Cut-Offs.  Do not cut-off piles until:  \u2022  The driven pile as-builts have been reviewed and approved by the Engineer \u2022  All piles within a pile group or within the area specified have been checked for heave \u2022  Any required restriking or redriving has been completed  Cut-off all piles perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile at the required elevations.  For piles that support timber caps or grillages, saw or otherwise cut off the pile to conform to the plane of the bottom of the superimposed structure.  Ensure that the amount of cut-off length is sufficient to  remove  any  portion  of  the  pile  top  that  has  been  trimmed  for  driving,  bruised,  or  otherwise deformed or damaged during driving.  Anchor cut-off piles to the structure or otherwise protect the pile until incorporated into the remainder of the work.  Retain the cut-off portions of all piles, including test piles, and make available for use in splicing or building up piles as required until the pile driving is complete.  Upon completion of the work,  SECTION 804 \u2014 DRIVEN PILES  800-27       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  piling cut-off lengths shall become the property of the Contractor and shall be properly disposed of off-site at the Contractor\u2019s expense.  Trim cut-off pile heads, cuts for bracing, and exposed abrasions of treated timber piles, and apply the  required  field  coatings  of  preservatives.    Coat  predrilled  bolt  holes  with  the  required  field preservative.  If treated holes will remain open, install field-treated wood plugs or other approved temporary plugs in the holes.  Where specified, after trimming and applying the preservative, bend down over the top of the pile a sheet of three-ply roofing felt, or a sheet of galvanized iron, not lighter than 24 gauge and of sufficient area to project at least 6 in. outside and completely around the pile head to fit tightly around  the  pile.    Trim  and  fasten  the  edges  of  this  cover  to  the  pile  face  with  large-headed galvanized roofing nails or bound with galvanized wire.  Clean  the  tops  and faces  of  precast  concrete  piles that  will  be  embedded  in the  structure  and remove minor chipping or spalling.  Cut off steel pipe piles and steel casings at the design elevation before emplacement of concrete fills.  If steel pipe or steel casing piles will remain unfilled, install the required protective caps.  804.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Piles Furnished.  Piles Furnished will be measured to the nearest linear foot of pile, calculated from the tip elevation to the specified cut-off elevation.  Measurement for Preliminary Test Piles will be made for that length authorized by the Engineer in  writing  before  delivery  of  piles  based on the  Plans  and  discussions  with  the  Contractor  and Construction Manager.  The additional footage of production or preliminary piles furnished at the Contractor\u2019s option will not be included in the quantity measured for payment.  Piles furnished by the Contractor to replace piles  that  were  previously  accepted  by  the  Engineer,  but  subsequently  damaged  before completion of the Contract, will not be measured for payment.

The Engineer may order the use of additional or stronger bracing and supports at any point where, based on his/her evaluation, sufficient bracing and supports have not been provided.  The Engineer may order additional temporary sheet piling to be installed when, based on his/her evaluation, field conditions make it necessary to properly protect the work under construction or any  existing  installation  affected  by  the  construction.    Use  washout  areas  for  concrete, excavatable fill, grout, etc., as directed by the Engineer.  Driving Sheet Piling and Soldier Piles.  Perform the preconstruction survey of adjacent structures and submit the findings to the Engineer for review.  Do not initiate any driving until the Engineer has approved the preconstruction survey. Perform  the  vibration  monitoring  during  the  driving  of  sheeting  or  piles.    Ensure  that  the preconstruction survey and vibration monitoring work conform to Subsection 804.03.11(a).  Drive the sheet piling and soldier piles reasonably true to the required line and depth.  Remove any material that interrupts the driving.  Drive the soldier piles to the location and axial tolerances specified in Subsection 804.03.12(f).  Pre-drilled Soldier Pile Installation.  Install soldier piles in pre-drilled or pre-augered holes 1) when required by the Plans or Special Provisions; or 2) when vibratory or impact driving is not permitted; or 3) when obstructions prevent driving,  and  the  Engineer  authorizes  pre-drilling  or  pre-augering  in  writing.    For  3),  resume standard driving when the obstruction has been removed or bypassed.  To  reach  the  required  depth  for  drilled  or  augered  holes,  use  methods  and  equipment  that maintain the sidewalls of the excavated shaft.  Clean out and remove soil materials, cuttings, and water  from  the  shaft  excavation  before  the  installation  of  soldier  piles  and  concrete  backfill. If  stockpiles  are  created,  comply  with  all  environmental  requirements  in  Subsection  104.15. This work and equipment are not considered for additional compensation.  Place soldier piles into the shaft to ensure that the piles do not sustain damage.  Vertically center and align the piles to ensure that their final position, when backfilled, meets the specified location and axial tolerances.  Remove and reinstall/replace damaged or out-of-tolerance soldier piles.  Place concrete, lean concrete, or other approved backfill in the shaft to encase the soldier pile. Place  the  concrete from  the  bottom  of  the  drilled  shaft  up  to  the  specified  elevation  or  ground surface.    Dewater  the  shaft  before  placing  concrete  backfill.    Comply  with  SECTION  208.    If dewatering is not feasible, use a tremie.  If during pumping, excessive water inflow is encountered, the Engineer may require alternative methods to reduce inflow, alter the concrete mix, or approve alternative backfill materials.  SECTION 805 \u2014 EARTH RETAINING SYSTEMS  800-33  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Allow  concrete  backfill  to  cure  for  a  minimum  of  five  days  before  excavation  and  lagging installation begins.  Do not allow equipment or other construction operations that might disturb the concrete in the vicinity of the installed pile until the concrete has cured.  Earthwork and Installation of Lagging.  Ensure that excavation conforms to Subsection 202.03 or 203.03.  Conduct the placement and securing of lagging to closely follow excavation in front of pile-and-lagging to ensure that the loss of ground is minimized.  Install lagging horizontally between soldier piles.  Allow excavation to proceed only as required to set one row of lagging.  When one row of lagging has been placed, initiate the excavation for the next lower row.  Openings and Cut-Offs.  Prepare and cut openings within the sheet piling or piles-and-lagging to permit the passage of all necessary utilities.  Cut off sheet piling, whether temporary or permanent, as necessary during construction to allow work to proceed.  Cut off permanent sheet piling in a straight line at the required elevations.  Cut off soldier piles cleanly and horizontally at the required elevations.  Remove concrete backfill, lagging, and other supports to the required elevations.  Installation of Ground Anchors.  Select the drilling method, the grouting procedure, and the grouting pressure to be used for the installation of the ground anchor as necessary to satisfy the load test requirements.  Use a method of  drilling  that  prevents  loss  of  ground  above  the  drilled  hole  that  may  be  detrimental  to  the structure or existing structures.  If water is used in the drilling operation, control and dispose of the  water  so  that  it  is  not  harmful  to  the  site,  environment,  or  adjacent  property.    Repair  any damage  caused  by  loss  of  ground  or  inadequate  control  of  water  at  no  additional  cost  to  the Department.  Ensure that the hole diameter in free length is not less than 3 in. nor greater than 12 in. and that the  hole  remains  open  until  grouting  begins.    Remove  casing,  if  used,  as  grouting  progresses unless  permitted  by  the  Engineer  to  remain  in  place.    When  the  tendon  cannot  be  completely inserted, remove the tendon and clean the drill hole or re-drill the hole to permit insertion of the tendon without difficulty.  Do not force partially inserted tendons into the hole.  Provide inclination and alignment to be within \u00b13 degrees of the design angle at the bearing plate and within \u00b112 in. of the planned location at the ground surface (point of entry).  The  Contractor  is  responsible  for  determining  the  anchor  bond  length  necessary  to  develop adequate load capacity to satisfy anchor testing acceptance criteria for the design load.  Ensure that the drilled anchor hole does not extend outside of the right-of-way limits.  Provide a minimum bond length of 10 ft in competent rock, 15 ft in soil, or the minimum in the Contract documents. Ensure that the anchor hole extends a minimum of 1 ft beyond the tendon length to be installed.  800-34  SECTION 805 \u2014 EARTH RETAINING SYSTEMS         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Produce  a  grout  free  of  lumps  and  undispersed  cement.  Equip  a  positive  displacement  grout pump with a gauge to monitor and record grout pressures.  Ensure that the pressure gauge is capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures anticipated, whichever is greater.  Size the grouting equipment so that the grout is pumped in one continuous operation.  Use a mixer that can continuously agitate the grout.  Inject the grout at the lowest point of the drill hole.  Fill the hole with grout progressively from the bottom to the top to prevent air voids.  The grout may be pumped through grout tubes, casings, hollow-stem augers, or drill rods.  Place the grout after the insertion of the tendon into the drill hole.    Record  the  quantity  of  grout  and  the  grout  pressures.    Control  the  grout  pressures  and quantities to prevent heave of the ground or fracturing of rock formations.  Except where modified below, the grout above the top of the bond length may be placed at the same time as the bond length grout.  Do not place the grout under pressure.  Ensure that the grout at the top of the hole stops a minimum of 6 in. from the back of the structure or trumpet, whichever is lowest.  If the ground anchor is installed in fine grained soil using a drilled hole larger than 6 in. in diameter, place the grout above the top of the bond length after the ground anchor has been successfully load tested.  If the grout is placed in two stages, ensure that the initial stage completely fills the hole to a point 2 ft above the bond length portion of the ground anchor.  The entire drill hole may be grouted at the same time if the Contractor\u2019s Rhode Island Professional Engineer can demonstrate that the ground anchor system does not derive a significant portion (less  than  5  percent)  of  its  load  resistance  from  the  soil  above  the  bond  length  portion  of  the ground anchor.  Upon completion of grouting, the grout tube may remain in the drill hole if filled with grout.  Also, after grouting, do not load the tendon for seven days, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.  Ensure that  tendons  are  free  of  dirt,  detrimental rust,  or other  deleterious  substances.   Before installation,  handle  and store  tendons  to  avoid  corrosion  and  physical  damage.    Tendons  with damage such as abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds, weld splatters, or heavy corrosion and pitting will be rejected.  Tendons with a slight rusting, if it is not sufficient to cause pits visible to the unaided eye, will not be rejected.  Do not ground welding leads to the tendon.  Degrease the bond length of the tendon before installation in the hole.  Do not allow solvent residue to remain on the tendon.  Load  test  each  ground  anchor  according  to  the  currently  adopted  edition  of  the  PTI \u201cRecommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors.\u201d  Do not apply a load greater than 10 percent  of  the  design  load  to  the  ground  anchor  before  load  testing.    Place  the  stressing equipment  over  the  ground  anchor  so  that  the  jack,  bearing  plates,  load  cell,  and  stressing anchorage are axially aligned with the tendon and the tendon is centered within the equipment. Apply the test simultaneously to the entire tendon.  During all testing, record the movement of the tendon at each load increment to the nearest 0.001 in. with a dial gauge or vernier scale.  Take measurements from a fixed reference point, and provide adequate travel clearance so that the total ground anchor movement can be measured without resetting the device.  Monitor the jack load with a load cell.  Apply each load increment as rapidly as practical (preferably in less than 30 seconds after the jack pump is started).  When  the  theoretical  elastic  elongation  of  the  total  anchor  length  at  the  maximum  test  load exceeds the jack\u2019s ram length, the Engineer must approve the procedure for recycling the jack ram.  Proceed with the load testing by incrementally loading the ground anchor according to the  SECTION 805 \u2014 EARTH RETAINING SYSTEMS  800-35     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  following schedule.  Raise the load from one increment to another immediately after recording the ground anchor movement.  Test Load Schedule AL 0.25 DL 0.50 DL 0.75 DL 1.00 DL 1.20 DL 1.33 DL 1.0 DL \u2013 LO  Where:  AL   =   Alignment Load DL   =   Design Load LO   =   Lock Off Load  Except for the 1.33 DL load, hold each load until the movement stabilizes for a minimum of one minute, and measure the ground anchor movement to the nearest 0.001 in. from a fixed reference point.    Hold  the  maximum  test  load  (1.33  DL)  constant  for  a  minimum  of  five  minutes  with movement measurements made at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 minutes.  If the difference between the 0.5- and  five-minute  measurements  is  greater  than  0.08  in.,  then  hold  the  1.33  DL  constant  for  an additional 50 minutes with measurements taken at 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes.  Construct a graph that plots the ground anchor movements versus load for each load increment in the test. At the completion of a successful load test, reduce the anchor load to 1.0 DL and transfer the load to the permanent stressing anchorage.  The ground anchor may be completely unloaded before lock-off.  After transferring the load and before removing the jack, record the lift-off load reading. Ensure that the lift-off load is within 10 percent of the specified lock-off load.  If the load is not within  10  percent  of  the  lock-off  load,  reset  the  anchorage  and  make  another  lift-off  reading. Repeat this process until the desired lock-off load is obtained.  The  acceptance  criteria for  proof  loading testing at  the maximum  specified test  load  (1.33  DL) are:  \u2022  Ensure that the total movement measured at the anchor head is greater than 80 percent  of the theoretical elastic elongation of the stressing length.  \u2022  Ensure that the total movement measured at the anchor head is less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the tendon length measured from the head of the jack to the center of the installed bond length.  \u2022  Ensure  that  the  creep  movement  measured  at  the  anchor  head  is  less  than  0.08  in. between the 0.5- and five-minute readings or less than 0.08 in. between the five- and 60- minute readings.  Measure the stressing length from the stressing anchorage to the bond length top.  If any anchor fails to meet acceptance criteria #1, either release the tension on the anchor, or remove the anchor and provide an additional anchor.  800-36  SECTION 805 \u2014 EARTH RETAINING SYSTEMS           Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  If any anchor fails to meet acceptance criteria #2 or #3, retest the anchor and determine the actual capacity that will produce the acceptance criteria.  Install an additional anchor according to this Specification at a location specified by the Engineer, and test to verify that the total capacity of the  two  anchors  exceeds  the  1.33  DL  load.    If  the  anchor  failure  is  through  no  fault  of  the Contractor,  then  compensation  will  be  made  for  additional  anchor(s)  and  for  the  required subsequent testing.  805.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Permanent Earth Retaining Systems.  Permanent Earth Retaining Systems are measured by the square foot of exposed face.  Exposed face is measured from the bottom of foundation level or approved excavation level, whichever is deeper, to the top of the adjacent ground surface to be maintained.  Temporary Earth Retaining Systems.  Temporary  earth  retaining  systems  are  incidental  to  the  work  items  that  require  the  retaining system and are not measured separately for payment.  805.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.  The Department will pay for the completed and accepted quantities as follows.  Permanent Earth Retaining Systems  Pay Item  Pay Unit  SF  Permanent Earth Retaining Systems.  The accepted quantity of Permanent Earth Retaining Systems will be paid for at the Contract unit price  per  square  foot.    The  price  constitutes  full  compensation  for  all  labor,  materials,  and equipment,  including  driving,  bracing,  cutting  and  removal  of  excess  quantities,  removal  of temporary  sheet  piling, and  all  incidentals  required  to finish  the  work,  complete  and  accepted. The price includes drilling or augering, piles, lagging, walers, bracing, anchors, and hardware.  The cost of preparation of openings for passing utilities will be included in the applicable unit bid price for sheet piling or soldier pile-and-lagging.  Drilling or Augering to Remove Obstructions.  When  obstructions  prevent  driving  using  standards  methods,  notify  the  Engineer  before proceeding.    The  Engineer  will  determine  if  a  differing  site  condition  exists  according  to Subsection 104.03.  The additional work will be paid according to Subsection 109.04.  SECTION 805 \u2014 EARTH RETAINING SYSTEMS  800-37             Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION  806.01  DESCRIPTION.  This  work  includes  heavy  timber  construction  for  bridge  superstructures,  roadway  decks, sidewalks, railings, and other similar applications.  806.02  MATERIALS.  Timber.  Use  sawn  lumber,  structural  glued  laminated  timber,  and  wood  preservative  treatment  that conforms to SECTION M11.  Hardware.  Use metal fastenings required for timber connections or for connecting timber to concrete or steel  work that conform to Subsection M05.05.13.  806.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Workmanship.  Ensure that all timber is cut and framed to a close fit so that the joints have even bearing over the entire contact surfaces.  Drive nails and spikes sufficiently to set the heads flush with the surface of  the  wood.    Evidence  of  deep  hammer  marks  in  wood  surfaces  will  be  sufficient  cause  for rejection of the work.  Remove timber scraps from cuts from the site on a regular basis to keep the work site neat and orderly.  Preservative Treatment of Timber and Lumber.  For all timber and lumber designated for treatment, use the pressure-treated process according to  the  standard  practices  of  the  American  Wood  Preservers  Association  (AWPA).    Use  the appropriate standards and specifications from AWPA for the Project conditions.  Use the \u201cempty cell\u201d pressure-treated process, followed by an expansion bath where applicable, vacuum to 22 in. of mercury at sea level, and perform a final steam cleaning.  Handling of Timber and Lumber.  a. Untreated  Timber.    Open-stack  untreated  timber  and  lumber  at  the  site  of  the  work  on supports  at  least  12  in.  above  the  ground.    Stack  and  strip  the  timber  to  permit  free circulation of air between the tiers and courses.  When required by the Engineer, protect the timber from the weather by suitable covering.  b. Treated Timber.  Close-stack and place treated timber and lumber to facilitate thorough drainage  of  any  preservative  remaining  on  the  material.    Use  timber  that  conforms  to AWPA Standard M4.  Comply with the following:  \u25cf Handling.  Handle treated timber without sudden dropping, bruising, breaking of outer fibers, or penetrating the surface with tools.  Handle with rope or web slings.  Do not  800-38  SECTION 806 \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  use  cant  hooks,  peaveys,  pikes,  or  hooks.    Provide  corner  protectors  to  prevent damage to timber bundled with metal bands or straps.  \u25cf  Cuts and Abrasions.  Perform all cutting, framing, and boring of treated timber before treatment as practical.  Apply three brush coats of hot preservative oil to all cuts and abrasions made after treatment.  Allow each coat to dry before the next coat is applied.  \u25cf  Holes.    Treat  with  preservative  oil  all  holes,  bored  after  treatment,  with  an  AWPA- approved  pressure  bolt  hole  treater  or  with  hot  preservative  oil  by  other  methods approved by AWPA.  Plug any unfilled holes, after being treated with preservative oil, with treated plugs.  \u25cf  Temporary  Attachments.    Forms  or  temporary  braces  may  be  attached  to  treated timber with nails or spikes only when approved by the Engineer.  Upon their removal, fill the holes by driving galvanized nails or spikes flush with the surface or by plugging as required for holes.  Installation of Connectors.  Install the split ring and the shear plate types in precut grooves of dimensions as recommended by the manufacturer.  Force spike grids into the wood so that timbers are in firm contact.  Use pressure equipment that does not damage the wood.  Cut connector grooves in timber concentric with the bolt hole, conforming to the cross-sectional shape of the rings and providing a snug fit.  Ensure that the inside groove diameter is larger than nominal ring diameter so that the ring will expand slightly during installation.  Perform the fabrication of all structural members using connectors before preservative treatment. When prefabricated from templates or shop details, ensure that the location of bolt holes is not more than 1/16 in. from the required placement.  Ensure that bolt holes are 1/16 in. larger than the finished bolt diameter.  Bore the bolt holes perpendicular to the face of the timber.  Store the timber after fabrication to prevent changes in the dimensions of the members before assembly.  Ensure that timber is cured before fabrication so that its dimensions remain stable. Timber that shrinks during storage causing predrilled grooves for split rings or plates to become elliptical or causing bolt hole spacing to change will be rejected.  Countersinking.  Perform  countersinking  where  smooth  faces  are  required.    Treat  recesses  formed  in  treated timber for countersinking as required for cuts and abrasions.  Hardware.  \u2022  Rods.    Thread  rods  connecting  only  sawed  timbers  at  each  end  to  provide  tight  connections, allowing only for permissible variations in the dimensions of material.  SECTION 806 \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION  800-39         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u2022 Bolts.    The  length  specified  is  the  length  measured  under  the  head.    Bolts  may  be substituted  for  rods  for  timber  connections  where  the  length  of  the  threaded  portion provided by the bolt is sufficient.  \u2022  Lag  Screws.  Install lag  screws  by  turning  them  into  place.    The screws may  be  driven sufficiently to start them into the holes and hold them firmly in place for turning.  Perform pre-drilling according to Subsection 806.03.7.  \u2022 Nuts  and  Washers.    Use  washers  or  plate  washers  under  all  nuts,  bolt  heads,  and  lag screws  that  would  otherwise  contact  with  wood,  except  under  large  diameter  heads  of specially designed flat head bolts.  Always use standard square nuts.  Tighten the nuts to prevent  the  rods  or  bolts  from  becoming  loose  during  service.    After  being  tightened, secure the nuts from backing off by the burring of the rod or bolt threads.  \u2022 Nails and Spikes.  Do not allow nails to extend through all material into which they pass unless  approved  by  the  Engineer.    Ensure  that  distance  and  spacing  adhere  to  the currently adopted versions of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the National Design Specification (NDS) for Wood Construction.  Drive nails or spikes through the thinner member into the thicker member.  Ensure that the nails and spikes are flush or countersunk to the member surface.  Drill pre-bored holes according to Subsection 806.03.7.  Holes for Bolts, Dowels, Rods, Lag Screws, Nails, and Spikes.  Bore holes for round drift bolts and dowels with a bit sized 1/16 in. less in diameter than the bolt or dowel to be used.  Ensure that the diameter of holes for square drift bolts or dowels is equal to the least dimension of the bolt or dowels.  Bore holes for machine bolts with a bit of the same diameter as the bolt up to 1/16 in. greater than the bolt diameter.  Bore holes for rods with a bit 1/16 in. greater in diameter than the rod.  Bore holes for lag screws with a bit not larger than the body of the screw at the base of the thread. To prevent splitting or stripping of the threads, bore a lead hole for the shank with a bit of the same diameter and to the same depth as the shank.  Ensure that the depth of holes for lag screws are 1 in. less than the length under the thread.  Do not drive lag screws into the lead hole with a hammer.  Instead, turn the screw in with a wrench.  Spikes and nails are generally hand-driven but may be power driven for the smaller diameters and lengths.  Pre-bore holes for large diameter spikes and nails (generally greater than \u00bc in.) to prevent the wood from splitting during driving.  Ensure that the diameter of the lead hole does not exceed 0.9 times the diameter of the fasteners for wood species with specific gravities greater than 0.6 and no more than 0.75 times the diameter of the fastener for wood species with specific gravities  less  than  0.6.    Do  not  allow  pre-bored  holes  to  extend  into  the  members  that  will  be holding the point of the nail or spike.  800-40  SECTION 806 \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Framing.  Cut and frame all lumber and timber to a close fit so that the joints have even bearing over the entire contact surfaces.  Ensure that mortises are true to size for their full depth and that tenons fit snugly.  Do not use shimming to make joints.  Open joints will be rejected.  Framed Bents.  \u2022  Mud  Sills.    Firmly  and  evenly  bed  mud  sills  to  solid  bearing  and  tamp  in  place.    Use pressure  preservative  treated  mud  sills  for  ground  contact.    Where  untreated  timber  is permitted for mud sills, use heart cedar, heart cypress, redwood, or other durable timber as approved by the Engineer.  \u2022  Concrete Pedestals.  Finish concrete pedestals for the support of framed bents so that the sills or posts will take even bearing.  Ensure that dowels for anchoring sills or posts are not less than \u00be in. in diameter and project at least 6 in. above the tops of the pedestals. Cast the dowels into the concrete pedestals.  \u2022  Sills.  Install sills that have true and even bearing on mud sills, piles, or pedestals.  Ensure that sills are drift-bolted to mud sills or piles with bolts of not less than \u00be-in. diameter and extend  into  the  mud  sills  or  piles  at  least  6  in.    When  practical,  remove  all  earth  from contact with sills so that there is free air circulation around the sills.  \u2022  Posts.  Fasten posts to pedestals with dowels of not less than \u00be-in. diameter, extending  at least 6 in. into the posts.  Fasten posts to sills by one of the following methods as indicated on the Plans:  \u25cb  By dowels of not less than \u00be-in. diameter, extending at least 6 in. into posts and sills  \u25cb  By drift-bolts of not less than \u00be-in. diameter driven diagonally through the base of the post and extending at least 9 in. into the sill.  Drive drift bolts into holes at a 45-degree angle to enter the post at least 6 in. above the post base.  \u25cb  By other types of connectors as detailed on the Plans.  \u2022  Caps.  Place timber caps, with ends aligned, to secure an even and uniform bearing over the tops of the supporting posts or piles.  Secure all caps by drift-bolts of not less than \u00be- in. diameter, extending at least 9 in. into the posts or piles.  Ensure that the drift bolts are approximately in the center of the post or pile.  \u2022  Bracing.  Bolt bracing through the pile, post, or cap at the ends and at all intermediate intersections  using  a  bolt  of  not  less  than  \u215d  in.  in  diameter.    Ensure  that  bracing  has sufficient length to provide a minimum distance of 8 in. between the outside bolt and the end of the brace.  Stringers.  Size the stringers at bearings and place them in position so that knots near edges are in the top portions of the stringers.  Other stringers may have butt joints with the ends cut on a taper, but lap interior stringers to take bearing over the full width of the floor beam or cap at each end.  Separate the lapped ends of  SECTION 806 \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION  800-41       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  untreated stringers at least \u00bd in. for the circulation of air, and secure the lapped ends fastened by drift-bolting.  Where stringers are two panels in length, stagger the joints.  Place timber stringers in position so that the deck has an even bearing on all stringers and so that any knots near edges are in the top portions of the stringers.  Outside stringers may have butt joints, centered over caps or floor beams, but lap interior stringers so that each rests completely over the full width of the cap or floor beams at each end.  Toenail the stringers to caps, and spike together the intermediate stringers of adjoining spans where they lap.  Properly frame the cross bridging between stringers, and ensure that the framing is securely toe- nailed with at least two nails in each end.  Ensure that all cross-bridging members have full bearing at each end against the sides of stringers.  Place 2 in. \u00d7 4 in. cross bridging at the center of each span.  Plank Floors.  Use planks for flooring that is surfaced four sides (S 4 S).  Use single plank floors that include a single thickness of plank supported by stringers or joists. Lay the plank\u2019s heart side down, with \u00bc-in. openings between them for seasoned material and with tight joints for unseasoned material.  Securely spike each plank to each joist.  Ensure that the  planks  are  graded  as  to  thickness  and  laid  to  ensure  that  no  two  adjacent  planks  vary  in thickness by more than \u215b in.  Use two-ply timber floors that include two layers of flooring supported on stringers or joists.  Lay the top course either diagonal or parallel to the centerline of roadway, and securely fasten each floor piece to the lower course.  Stagger joints at least 3 ft.  If the top flooring is placed parallel to the centerline of the roadway, securely fasten the ends of the flooring.  At each end of the bridge, bevel these members.  Nailed or Glued Laminated Strip Floors.  Use nailed or glued laminated strip floors that include individual lumber strips.  Place the strips on edge as described in the Plans to the previous strip to form a continuous surface.  Construct the laminated strip floors either on top of stringers at right angles to the centerline of roadway or on top of floor beams running parallel to the roadway centerline.  Use spikes that are of sufficient length to pass through two strips and at least one-half of the third strip.  If timber supports are used, toenail every other strip to every other support.  If steel supports are used, securely fasten the strips to the supports at the required locations and spacing.  Ensure  that  each  strip  is  vertical  and  tight  against  the  preceding  strip  and  bears  evenly  on  all supports.  Laminated Panel Decks.  Use  laminated  panel  decks that  include  stress  laminated  sawn  lumber  strips.   Place the  strips with their wide side vertical and fastened together to form panels.  Provide fastening as described in the Plans.  Panels may be interconnected using spliced, bolted, or doweled ship-lap joints, steel  800-42  SECTION 806 \u2014 TIMBER CONSTRUCTION        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  dowels, or high strength steel stressing rods.  Alternatively, panels may be assembled in a non- interconnected fashion.  Panels  may  be  used  longitudinally  with  stringers,  composite  stringers,  without  stringers,  or transversely across steel or wood stringers.  Wheel Guards and Railings.  Frame the wheel guards and railings and erect them true to line and grade.  Use wheel guards, rails, and rail posts that are surfaced on four sides (S 4 S).  Lay the wheel guards in sections not less than 12 ft long, except where necessary to match expansion joints or end joints.  Trusses.  Ensure that the trusses, when completed, have no irregularities of line.  Ensure that the chords are straight and true from end to end in horizontal projection and, in vertical projection, present a smooth  curve  through  panel  points  conforming to  the  correct  camber.  Ensure  that  all  bearing surfaces fit accurately.  Uneven or rough cuts at the points of bearing will result in rejection of the piece containing the defect.  806.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Timber Construction will be measured by the number of board feet placed in various parts of the completed structure.  The computation of quantity will be based on the nominal commercial widths and thicknesses of the respective materials.  806.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.  The Department will pay for the completed and accepted quantities as follows.  Pay Item  Timber Construction  Pay Unit  BF  Payment  at  the  Contract  unit  price  is  full  compensation  for  all  resources,  labor,  materials, equipment, and incidentals required to finish the work, complete and accepted.

Do not construct stone, brick, or block masonry using mortar or grout when the atmospheric or surface  temperature  is  below  40\u00b0F,  when  the  respective  units  contain  frost,  or  when  the temperature is expected to drop below 40\u00b0F within 24 hours of placement, except with the written permission  of  the  Engineer  subject  to  any  required  conditions.    Remove  and  replace  all  work damaged by cold weather at no additional cost to the Department.  In hot or dry weather, protect  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION  800-45  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  the masonry from the sun, and cure by keeping the masonry or its covering wet for a period of three days after completion.  Mixing of Mortar and Grout.  Proportion the mortar and grout for masonry construction as specified in Subsections 807.02.3 and 807.02.7.  Either hand or machine mix the mortar, as required by the Engineer.  In the preparation of hand- mixed mortar, thoroughly mix the sand and cement together in a clean, tight mortar box until the mixture has uniform color.  Add sufficient clean water to form a stiff plastic mass.  Prepare the mortar mix for not less than three minutes nor more than 10 minutes.  Do not mix the mortar on the roadway surface.  Add sufficient water to provide a mortar consistency that can be handled easily and spread with a  trowel.    Ensure  that  the  water  is  fresh,  clean  water,  which  is  not  used  from  a  stormwater conveyance system.  Mix mortar and/or grout only in those quantities required for immediate use.  Discard mortar not used within 45 minutes after water has been added or before initial set begins, whichever occurs first.  Stone Masonry Construction.  a.  Manufacture of Stone for Masonry.  1.  General.  Ensure that each stone is free from depressions and projections that could weaken or prevent the stone from proper embedment.  Provide a shape to meet the requirements for the class of masonry specified.  \u2022  Furnish  stones  in  the  sizes  and  face  areas  necessary  to  produce  the  required  characteristics and appearance.  \u2022  Ensure that the thickness of courses, if varied, diminish regularly from bottom to  top of wall.  \u2022  Use header lengths that are not less than the width of bed of the widest adjacent  stretcher plus 12 in.  2.  Rubble Masonry.  \u2022  Size.  Use individual stones that have a thickness of not less than 8 in. and a width of not less than 1\u00bd times the thickness.  Do not use stones, except headers, that have a length less than 1\u00bd times their width.  \u2022  Shape.    Use  stones  that  are  roughly  squared  on  joints,  beds,  and  faces.    Use selected stone, roughly squared and pitched to line, at all angles and ends of walls. If specified, finish all corners or angles in exterior surfaces with a chisel draft.  800-46  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u2022  Bed Surface.  Ensure that bed surfaces of face stones are normal to the faces of the  stones  for  approximately  3  in.    From  this  point,  ensure  that  surfaces  depart from normal not more than 2 in. in 12 in.  Provide joint surfaces of face stones that form an angle with the bed surfaces of not less than 45 degrees.  \u2022  Laying Stone in Wall.  Perform all shaping or dressing of stone before the stone is laid in the wall.  Do not allow dressing or hammering to loosen the stone after it is placed.  \u2022  Dressing.  Dress the stone to remove any thin or weak portions.  Dress face stones to provide bed and joint lines with a maximum variation from true line of 1\u00bd in.  \u2022  Other.    Construct  rubble  masonry  and  dry  rubble  masonry  according  to  the  applicable requirements of SECTION 911 and SECTION 912.  3.  Ashlar Masonry.  \u2022  Size.  Use individual stones that are large and well proportioned.  Provide stones  that are not less than 12 in. nor more than 30 in. in thickness.  \u2022  Dressing.  Dress stones to the exact sizes and shapes before being laid.  Cut the stones to lie on their natural beds with top and bottom truly parallel.  Do not use hollow beds.  Ensure that the bottom bed is the full size of the stone and that no stone has an overhanging top.  In rock-face construction, ensure that the face side of any stone does not present an undercut contour adjacent to its bottom arris that yields a top-heavy, unstable appearance when laid.  Fine finish the beds of face stone for a depth of not less than 12 in.  Fine finish the vertical joints of face stone, which must be full to the square for a depth of not less than 9 in.  Provide exposed surfaces of the face stone with edges pitched to true lines and exact  batter.   Cut chisel  drafts  1\u00bd-in.  wide  at  all  exterior corners.    Rough  finish face stone forming the starling or nosing of piers.  Do not allow holes for stone hooks to be visible in exposed surfaces.  \u2022  Stretchers.  Use stretchers that have a width of bed of not less than 1\u00bd times their thickness.  Ensure that the stretchers have a length of bed not less than twice nor more than 3\u00bd times their thickness and not less than 3 ft.  4.  Arch Ring Stones.  Ensure that the arch ring stone joint surfaces are radial and at right angles to the front faces of the stones.  Dress the surfaces for a distance of at least 3 in. from the front faces and the soffits, from which points they may depart from a plane normal to the face not to exceed \u00be in. to 12 in.  Ensure that the back surface in contact with the concrete of the arch barrel is parallel to the front face and is dressed for 6 in. from the intrados.  Cut the top perpendicular to the front face, and dress the top for a distance of at least 3 in. from the front.  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION  800-47     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  When concrete will be placed after the masonry has been constructed, ensure that the adjacent ring stones vary at least 6 in. in depth.  Ensure that the stratification in arch ring stones is parallel to the radial joints and, in other stones, is parallel to the beds.  Lay  out  a  full-size  template  of  the  arch  ring  near  the  quarry  site,  showing  face dimensions of each ring stone and thickness of joints.  The Engineer will the template before  the  shaping  of  any  ring  stone  is  started.    Do  not  place  the  ring  stone  in  the structure  until  all  ring  stones  have  been  shaped,  dressed,  and  approved  by  the Engineer.  b.  Selection and Placing of Stone.  1.  General.  When masonry is placed on a prepared foundation bed, ensure that the bed is firm and normal to, or in steps normal to, the face of the wall, and approved by the Engineer before any stone is placed.  When it is placed on foundation masonry, clean the  bearing  surface  of  the  foundation  masonry  and  ensure  that  the  surface  is  in  a saturated-surface dry condition when the mortar bed is spread.  Set face stones in a random bond to produce the required effect.  Prevent the bunching of small stones or stones of the same size.  When weathered or colored stones or stones of varying texture are being used, distribute the various kinds of stones uniformly throughout the exposed faces of the work.  Use large stones for the bottom courses and use large, selected stones in the corners.  In general, ensure that the stones decrease in size from the bottom to the top of work.  Clean and saturate each stone with water before being set.  Ensure that the bed that will receive the stone is clean and well moistened.  Bed all stones securely in freshly made mortar.    Ensure that  the  mortar joints  are  full  and  the  stones  settled  in  place before the mortar has set.  Any spalls in the beds will result in rejection.  Do not pin up any stones with spalls in beds.  Do not drop any stones on or slide them over the wall.  Do not hammer, roll, or turn the stones on the wall.  Set the stones without jarring the stone already laid, and handle with an appliance that will not cause disfigurement.  If any stone is moved or the joint broken, remove the stone, clean the mortar from the bed and joints, and reset the stone in fresh mortar.  2.  Rubble Masonry.  Lay rubble masonry to line and in courses roughly leveled up.  For the bottom or foundation courses, use large, selected stones and lay all courses with bearing beds parallel to the natural bed of the material.  Ensure that the vertical joints in each course of rubble masonry break with those in adjoining courses at least 6 in. Do not locate a vertical joint directly above or below a header.  3.  Ashlar  Masonry.    For  all  range  cut  stone  masonry,  lay  the  stone  with  alternating stretchers and headers.  Place stones in any one course of ashlar masonry to form bonds of not less than 12 in. with the stones of adjoining courses.  Place headers over  800-48  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  stretchers and, in general, ensure that the headers of each course equally divide the spaces between the headers of adjoining courses.  Do not place a header over a joint, and do not install a joint over a header.  4.  Split Face.  For all split faced masonry, use selected stones, squared and pitched to line,  at  all  angles,  wall  expansion  and  contraction  joints,  and  other  arrises.    Dress copings and belt stones for the required jointing, and pitch exposed corners parallel to each other.  Ensure that exposed surfaces have projections of not more than 1 in.  Cut the bed and interior ends normal to the pitch lines.  5.  Sample Section.  If required, construct at a designated location a sample section of wall not less than 5 ft high and 8 ft long, showing examples of the face wall and method of forming joints.  The Engineer must approve the sample section before the start of wall facing.  If approved, the sample section may be incorporated into the final product, subject to final inspection and acceptance.  c.  Beds, Joints, and Pointing.  1.  Beds and Joints.  Do not allow face joints for all cut stone to exceed \u00bd in.; face joints for split face masonry to exceed 1 in.; and face joints for rubble masonry to exceed 1\u00bd in.  Ensure that the joints in the interior of the wall average not more than 1\u00bd in. for rubble masonry.  The thickness or beds in ashlar masonry may vary as shown from the bottom to the top  of  the  work.    However,  in  each  course,  ensure  that  the  beds  have  a  uniform thickness throughout.  Do not allow beds to extend in an unbroken line through more than five stones.  Provide vertical joints in ashlar masonry.  In all other masonry, joints may be at angles with the vertical from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.  Ensure  that  each  face  stone  bonds  with  all  contiguous  face  stones  at  least  6  in. longitudinally and 2 in. vertically.  Ensure that ring stone joints on the faces and soffits are not less than \u00be in. nor more than 1\u00bd in. in thickness.  Provide  level  cross  beds  for  vertical  walls.    Battered  walls  may  vary  from  level  to normal to the batter line of the face of the wall.  Fill all joints with mortar.  2.  Pointing.  Do not perform pointing in freezing weather or when the stone contains frost.  When practical, point face joints before the mortar sets.  Prepare joints that cannot be immediately pointed for pointing by raking the joints out to a depth of 2 in. before the mortar has set.  Ensure that the stone face surfaces are not smeared with any mortar.  Wet joints not pointed at the time the stone is laid with clean water and fill with mortar. Ensure that the mortar is driven into the joints and finished with an approved pointing tool.  Slightly crown the mortar in joints on top surfaces at the center of the masonry to provide drainage.  Ensure that walls remain wet while pointing is being performed.  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION  800-49     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  In hot or dry weather, protect the pointed masonry from the sun and keep the walls wet for at least three days after completion.  After the pointing is completed and the mortar set, thoroughly clean the wall.  d.  Headers.  Ensure that headers hold in the heart of the wall the same size as shown in the face and that they extend not less than 12 in. into the core.  Ensure that headers occupy not less than one-fifth of the face area of the wall and are evenly distributed.  Provide headers in walls 3 ft or less in thickness that extend entirely through the wall.  Place headers in ashlar masonry in each course that has a width of not less than 1\u00bd times their thickness.   In  walls  having  a thickness of  4  ft  or  less,  extend the  headers  entirely through the wall.  In walls of greater thickness, provide a length of headers that is not less than 2\u00bd times their thickness when the course is 18 in. or less in height and not less than 4 ft in courses of greater height.  Space the headers not further apart than 8 ft center to center.  Provide at least one header to every two stretchers.  e.  Cores and Backing.  1.  General.    Provide  cores  and  backing  that  consist  either  of  compactly  laid  and  interlocked stones including headers and stretchers or of concrete.  Provide headers and stretchers in walls that have a thickness of 3 ft or less that have a width or length equal to the full thickness of the wall.  Do not use backing or core.  2.  Stone.  When stone is used for cores or backing, ensure that at least one-half of the stone is the same size and character as the face stone and that the remaining stones have sizes and shapes that facilitate proper interlocking with face stones.  Ensure that all courses are less than 8 in. thick.  Lay  stone  backing  in  the  same  manner  as  specified  for  face  stone,  with  headers interlocking with face headers when the thickness of the wall permits.  Lay backing to break joints with the face stone.  Lay stone cores in full mortar beds to bond not less than 12 in. with face and backing stone and with each other.  Ensure that bed joints in cores  and  backing  do  not  exceed  1  in.  in  thickness  and  that  vertical  joints  do  not exceed 2 in. in width.  3.  Concrete.  Place and consolidate concrete adjacent to the ashlar masonry facing to ensure that all spaces around the stones are filled and that provide full contact and efficient bond with all stone surfaces.  4.  Leveling  Courses.    Ensure  that  the  elevation  of  stone  cores  and  backing  are approximately level with the face course before the succeeding course is started.  5.  Concrete Backing.  Construct the stone masonry before placing concrete.  6.  Use steel anchors.  To improve the bond between the stone masonry and the concrete  backing, install the back of the masonry as unevenly as the stones permit.  800-50  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  After the stone facing has been laid and the mortar has attained sufficient strength, clean  all  surfaces  against  which  concrete  will  be  placed,  and  remove  all  dirt,  loose material, and accumulations of mortar droppings.  When  placing  concrete,  fill  all  interstices  of  the  masonry,  and  spade  and  work  the concrete until it has tight contact with every part of the back of the masonry.  Place horizontal construction joints in the concrete backing at grades that will break joints  of  the  stone  facing.    Provide  concrete  courses  that  are  approximately  4  ft  in depth.  f.  Dowels  and  Cramps.    Where  required,  secure  the  coping  stone,  stone  in  the  wings  of abutments,  and  stone  in  piers  with  wrought  iron,  galvanized  steel,  or  stainless  steel cramps or dowels.  Drill  dowel  holes  that  will  be  covered  by  stone masonry through  each  stone  before the stone is placed and, after it is in place, extend the dowel holes by drilling into the underlying course not less than 6 in.  On stones where it is desirable to avoid drill holes through the top surfaces, conceal by setting and grouting the stones over dowels set in the preceding course or by a similar method.  Inset cramps or dowels in the stone to clear the bed of the succeeding course.  Locate the cramps or dowels to securely bond the stone courses together and the stone facing to the concrete backing.  Set cramps and dowels in lead to completely fill the surrounding spaces with the molten metal.  Otherwise, rigidly anchor the cramps or dowels by other means approved by the Engineer.  g.  Copings.  Use the required and dimensioned stones for copings of wall, pier, and abutment bridge seats.  On piers, do not use more than two stones to provide the entire width of coping.  Use copings at abutment bridge seats that have sufficient width to extend at least 4 in. under the backwall.  Form each step of the coping of a wingwall with a single stone that overlaps the stone forming the step immediately below at least 12 in.  For tops of copings, provide a bevel cut at least 2 in. wide, and fine finish the beds, bevel cuts, and tops.  Smooth finish the vertical joints, and lay the copings with joints not more than \u00bc in. thick.  Provide a drip bead to the underside of projecting copings.  Locate joints in copings to provide not less than a 12-in. bond with the stones of the under course  and to  ensure that  no joint  will  come  directly  under  the superstructure  masonry plates.  h.  Bracing.  The Engineer will determine if bracing is necessary to hold the stone in place.  i.  Cleaning Exposed Surfaces.  Clean from all face stones any mortar stains immediately after placement and while the mortar is fresh.  Ensure that the stones remain clean until the work is completed.  After the pointing is completed and the mortar set, clean the wall.  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION  800-51      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Brick or Block Masonry.  a.  Laying Brick and Block.  Lay the blocks or bricks to bond them into the mortar by using the \u201cshove-joint\u201d method; do not use \u201cbuttered\u201d or plastered joints.  Saturate surface dry with  water  all  clay  or  shale  brick  before  placement.   Do  not  dampen  concrete masonry units  before  or  during  construction,  unless  approved  by  the  Engineer.    Arrange  the headers  and  stretchers  to  bond  the  mass,  and  proceed  with  alternate  headers  and stretchers with consecutive courses breaking joints.  Fill all joints with mortar.  Provide joints that are not less than \u00bc in. and not more than \u215d in. in thickness.  Ensure that the thickness is uniform throughout.  Finish all joints as the work progresses and, on exposed faces, neatly strike the joints using the weather joint.  Do  not  use  any  spalls  or  bats  except  for  shaping  around  irregular  openings  or  when unavoidable to finish out a course.  When used, place full bricks at the corners, placing the bats in the interior of the course.  Adjust  each  masonry  unit  to  its  final  position  while  the  mortar  is  still  soft  and  plastic. Remove units that are disturbed after the mortar has stiffened and relay in fresh mortar.  Align vertical cells to be filled with grout to provide a continuous unobstructed opening.  Piers and walls may be built of solid brick work or may include a brick or block shell backed with concrete.  b.  Placement of Reinforcement.  Before and during grouting, secure the reinforcing steel in position at the top and bottom and at intermediate points not exceeding 200 bar diameters or 10 ft apart.  Ensure that bars are clear of the cell walls and within \u00b1\u00bd in. of their planned position transverse to the wall and within \u00b12 in. of their planned position longitudinal to the wall.  c.  Grouted Brick or Block Construction.  Construct grouted masonry so that all elements of  the masonry act together as a structural element.  Before  grouting,  clean  the  grout  space  so  that  all  spaces  to  be  filled  with  grout  do  not contain mortar projections greater than \u00bd in., mortar droppings, or other foreign material. Place grout so that all spaces to be grouted do not contain voids.  Control  grout  materials  and  water  content  to  provide  adequate  fluidity  for  placement without segregation.  Ensure that size and height limitations of the grout space or cell on average are not less than the values in the Table below.  The Engineer may approve the use of higher grout pours  or  smaller  cavity  widths  or  cell  sizes  than  shown  in  the  Table  below,  if  it  is demonstrated that grout spaces are properly filled.  When required by the Table, provide cleanouts in the bottom course at every vertical bar but not be spaced more than 32 in. on center for solidly grouted masonry.  Ensure that cleanouts have sufficient size to allow removal of debris.  800-52  SECTION 807 \u2014 MASONRY CONSTRUCTION      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Grout Pour Maximum Height (ft) 1 5 8 12 24 1 5 8 12 24  Grout Type  Fine Fine Fine Fine Fine Coarse Coarse Coarse Coarse Coarse  Notes:  Grouting Limitations  Width of Grout Space (in.)2  Cell Dimensions (in. \u00d7 in.)

Units may be laid to the full height of the grout pour.  Place grout in a continuous pour in grout lifts not exceeding 6 ft.  If construction joints are used in columns of grout, locate the joints at least 1\u00bd in. below the level of a mortar bed joint.  Avoid segregation of the grout materials and damage to the masonry during the grouting process.  Consolidate  the  grout  before  loss  of  plasticity  to  fill  the  grout  space.    Mechanically reconsolidate grout pours greater than 12 in. in height to minimize voids due to water loss. Puddle any grout not mechanically vibrated.  In  nonstructural  elements,  mortar  that  is  of  pouring  consistency  may  be  substituted  for grout when the masonry is constructed and grouted in pours of 12 in. or less.  Vertical barriers of masonry may be built across the grout space.  Complete the grouting of  any section  of  wall  between  barriers  in  one  day  with  no  interruption  longer than  one hour.  807.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Stone Masonry.  Stone masonry will be measured by the number of square feet of exposed wall surface placed.

This  work  includes  providing  cast-in-place  concrete  in  bridges,  walls,  culverts,  and  other miscellaneous structures at the required locations.  The work includes structures constructed by cast-in-place methods using either plain or reinforced concrete or a combination.  808.02  MATERIALS.  Concrete.  Use materials that conform to SECTION 601.  Joint Fillers and Sealants.  Use materials that conform to:  \u2022  Subsection M02.10.1 \u2022  Subsection M02.10.2 \u2022  Subsection M02.10.3  808.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  General.  \u25cf   Subsection M02.10.4 \u25cf  Subsection M02.10.5  Comply  with  SECTION  601  for  classification,  proportioning,  batching,  mixing,  transportation, placing, curing, and testing of concrete.  Footings.  Prepare foundations that conform to SECTION 203.  Do not place concrete until the Engineer has approved  the  depth  and  dimensions  of  the  excavation,  the  character  of  the  material,  and  the condition  of  the  foundation.    Do  not  support  a  footing  partially  on  rock  and  partially  on  soil. Excavate the rock to allow the placement of 12 in. of gravel according to Subsection 203.03.1. The Engineer may direct, in writing, changes in dimensions or elevations of footings as may be necessary to obtain satisfactory foundations.  The Plans will be revised accordingly.  For foundations under water, the Contractor is responsible for quality control, which may require a diver to inspect and monitor the construction of the foundation.  Falsework and Centering.  Ensure  that  all  falsework  or  centering  is  adequate  for  the  type  of  construction  involved  and conforms to Section 3-2, Falsework and Forms, of the currently adopted edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications.  Submit all Shop Drawings for falsework and centering, including design computations signed and sealed by the Contractor\u2019s Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer, according to Subsection 105.02.  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-55                             Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  The Contractor\u2019s Professional Engineer shall certify in writing that the falsework system has been assembled and constructed according to the approved falsework drawings.  Do not place loads on the falsework before submittal of the certification.  When structures will be constructed over railroad tracks, ensure that the centering conforms to the requirements of the railroad company for temporary operating clearances, safety, and design.  Forms.  a.  General.    Prepare  detailed  plans  for  all  required  forms,  including  design  computations signed and sealed by the Contractor\u2019s Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer, according to Subsection 105.02.  The Engineer will approve the plans in writing before any work is initiated on construction of the forms.  Do not use snap ties, and ensure that removable  cones  meet  the  minimum  diameter  requirement.    Where  forms  will  be suspended from the structural steel girders, do not use snap tie hangers, wires, or other devices that cannot be adjusted to provide mortar tight joints.  Do not allow slab forms to bear on interior diaphragms.  Do  not  install  forms  over  steel  supporting  members  until  after  the  steel  erection  and touchup painting is completed.  Include  a  provision  in  the  form  for  a  standard  \u00be-in.  symmetrical  chamfer  at  all  square entrant concrete corners.  b.  Wood  Forms.    Construct  all  face  forms  of  lumber  \u00be  in.  or more  in thickness  lined  with plywood  not  less  than  1\u00bc  in.  in  thickness.    Sheet  metal  (preferably  noncorrosive)  of approved gauge may be substituted.  As an alternative method of construction, face forms may consist of plywood, \u215d in. or more in thickness, without backing boards if properly designed and supported.  Ensure that the alternative construction provides a rigid form that prevents unacceptable deformations in the finished concrete surface.  Provide plywood forms that are tempered or waterproofed at the time of manufacture to prevent the absorption of moisture.  When lining is used, use wood forms that require the usual construction with the boards closely  spaced.    Provide  the  lining  in  sheets  of  maximum  useable  size,  and  apply  the smooth side to the concrete.  Tape or fill joints between panels to provide a smooth, tight form surface.  Construct  metal  ties  or  anchorages  that  are  required  within  the  forms  to  hold  them  to correct alignment and location so that the metal work can be removed to a depth of at least 2 in. from the exposed surface of the concrete without causing injury to the surface by spalling or otherwise.  When permitted for secondary forms, cut back all wires, upon removal  of the  forms,  at  least \u00bd  in.  from  the face  of the  concrete  with  sharp chisels  or nippers.  Use all fittings for metal ties of a design that, upon their removal, the cavities that remain are of the smallest size.  Fill the cavities with cement mortar of fine aggregate and cement  800-56  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  in the proportion that has been employed for the class of concrete treated.  Ensure that the surface is smooth, even, and uniform in color.  Ensure that formwork lines are straight and true and that forms are mortar tight, well tied, and braced to prevent bulging.  Ensure that block shims or wedges are secured before placing concrete.  Treat formwork with a form release agent approved by the Engineer just before placing concrete.  Use a form release agent that will not discolor or otherwise injuriously affect the concrete surface or subsequent finish.  Apply release agents to the forms before the reinforcement is placed.  Remove all excess release agent from the face surfaces, and clean the ties and reinforcement with an approved solvent where necessary.  c.  Metal Forms.  Use the applicable requirements for wood forms that apply to metal forms. Use a metal for forms that is of such thickness that the forms will remain true to shape. Ensure  that  all  bolt  and  rivet  heads  are  countersunk.    Use  clamps,  pins,  or  other connecting  devices  that  are  designed  to  hold  the  forms  rigidly  together  and  to  allow removal  without  injury  to  the  concrete.    Do  not  use  metal  forms  that  do  not  present  a smooth  surface  or  line  up  properly.    Keep  metal  forms  free  from  rust,  grease,  or  other foreign matter that will discolor the concrete.  Placing Concrete (Conventional Method).  a.  General.  In preparation for the placing of concrete, remove all sawdust, chips, standing water,  and  other  construction  debris  and  extraneous  matter  from  the  interior  of  forms. Remove struts, stays, and braces serving temporarily to hold the forms in correct shape and  alignment,  pending  the  placing  of  concrete  at  their  locations,  when  the  concrete placing  has  reached  an  elevation  rendering  their  service  unnecessary.    Remove  these temporary  members  from  the  forms.    Cut  back  any  hardware  allowed  to  remain  in  the formwork to the design cover for reinforcement.  Fill the resulting recess in the concrete surface with a patching mortar that matches the concrete color approved by the Engineer.  Notify the Engineer 48 hours in advance of placing concrete to provide ample time for the inspection  of  forms,  steel  reinforcement,  materials,  and  equipment.    Submit  a  plan  for concrete washout to ensure that there is a sufficient volume and an appropriate location before starting concrete placement operations.  Place and consolidate concrete to not cause segregation of materials or displacement of reinforcement  and  to  provide  a  dense  homogeneous  concrete  that  is  free  of  voids  and rock pockets.  If the quality of the concrete is inadequate, stop work immediately until the quality issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Engineer.  Use metal or metal-lined open chutes.  Where steep slopes are required, ensure that the chutes  are  equipped  with  baffles  erected  in  short  lengths  to  slow  the  movement  of concrete.  Ensure that each part of the form is filled by depositing the concrete as near to its final position as practical.  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-57      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Do not drop concrete more than 5 ft.  Use a tube with a hopper head or other approved device to prevent segregation of the mix and splattering of mortar.  Ensure that all chutes and pipes remain clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete by flushing with water after each run.  For washout of chutes and pipes only, direct the concrete into an appropriate concrete washout area.  Otherwise, properly dispose of any leftover concrete.  Consolidate concrete by mechanical, high frequency internal or external vibrators, or both, as acceptable to the Engineer.  Equip handheld vibrators with rubber tipped heads when used to consolidate around the reinforcement.  Ensure that the vibration at any point has sufficient  duration  to  accomplish  thorough  consolidation  but  not  be  prolonged  to  cause segregation or bleeding.  Do  not  use  vibration  directly  to  or  through  the  reinforcement  to  sections  or  layers  of concrete that have hardened so that the concrete ceases to be plastic under vibration.  Do not use vibrators to transport concrete within the forms.  Continuously place concrete in horizontal layers to prevent separation planes.  When less than a 12-in. layer is placed in one operation, terminate the layer in a vertical bulkhead. Place and consolidate each layer before the preceding course has taken initial set to avoid the formation of a cold joint.  If the placing of concrete is temporarily delayed, cover the concrete immediately and keep moist to retard initial set until placement can resume.  If placing of concrete is temporarily discontinued, form a construction joint immediately.  Do not allow any cold joints.  Clean laitance and other objectionable material from the new construction joint when placement is scheduled to resume.  To  avoid  visible  joints  as  practical  upon  exposed  faces,  smooth  the  top  surface  of  the concrete adjacent to the forms with a trowel.  Where a feather edge might be produced at a construction joint, as in the sloped surface of a wingwall, use an inset form to produce a blocked out portion in the preceding layer that produces an edge thickness of not less than 6 in. in the succeeding layer.  Do not discontinue work within 18 in. of the top of any face, unless provision has been made for a coping less than 18 in. thick.  In this case, and if permitted  by  the  Engineer,  the  construction  joint  may  be  made  at  the  underside  of  the coping.  Immediately following the discontinuance of placing concrete, remove all accumulations of mortar splashed upon the reinforcing steel and the surface of forms.  Do not puddle dried mortar chips and dust into the unset concrete.  If the accumulations are not removed before the concrete becomes set, do not damage or break the concrete steel bond at and near the surface of the concrete while cleaning the reinforcing steel.  b.  Vertical  Members.    Place  and  allow  to  set  and  settle  the  concrete  for  columns, substructure, culvert walls, and other similar vertical members for a sufficient amount of time before the concrete for integral horizontal members, such as caps, slabs, or footings, is placed.  Ensure that the time is adequate to allow completion of settlement due to loss of bleed water.  This is not less than 12 hours for vertical members over 15 ft in height and not less than 30 minutes for members over 5 ft but not over 15 ft in height.  When friction  800-58  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  collars or falsework brackets are mounted on the vertical members, ensure that the vertical member  is  in  place  at  least  seven  days  and  has  attained  its  specified  design  strength before loads from horizontal members are applied.  c.  Slabs.  Before any slab concrete is placed, have access to an approved finishing tool for  striking off the surface of the slab to the required crown.  For bridge deck slabs, refer to SECTION 814.  d.  Superstructure.  Do not place any concrete in the superstructure until the substructure has reached  its  specified  design  strength  and  the  substructure  forms  have  been  stripped sufficiently to determine the character of the supporting substructure concrete.  Concrete for T-beam or deck girder spans with depths less than 4 ft may be placed in one continuous operation or may be placed in two separate operations \u2015 first, to the top of the girder stems and, second, to completion.  For T-beam or deck girder spans with depths 4 ft or more and, unless the falsework is non-yielding, place the concrete in two operations. Ensure that at least five days have elapsed after placement of stems before the top deck slab is placed.  e.  Arch Rings.  Place the concrete in arch rings to load the centering uniformly.  Cast arch rings and ribs preferably in a single continuous operation.  However, with the approval of the Engineer, the arch rings and ribs may be divided by radial bulkheads into transverse sections  of  a  size  that  each  section  can  be  cast  in  a  continuous  operation.    The arrangement  of  the  sections  and  the  sequence  of  placing  will  be  approved  by  the Engineer.   Ensure  that  the  arrangement  does  not  distort  the  centering  and  consequent creation  of  initial  stress  in  the  newly  placed  concrete  or  its  reinforcement.    Bond  the sections  together  by  suitable  keys.    Where  special  key  sections  are  required,  mix  the concrete as dry as practical and consolidate by vibration.  Do not cast the spandrel walls or columns and the beams until after the centering is struck.  Do not cast any part of the coping, railing, or floor until the spandrel walls or columns are complete.  Where casting spandrel  wall  elements  on  newly  constructed  arch  rings,  ensure  that  the  concrete  has reached its required compressive strength before casting.  f.  Placing  Concrete  Under  Water.    Do  not  place  concrete  under  water  except  with  the approval of the Engineer and under his/her supervision.  In this case, the method of placing will be as specified.  Ensure that concrete placed under water conforms to Subsection 601.02.1.  Use a tremie to place concrete in water and do not disturb after placement.  Maintain still water at the point of placement and ensure that the forms under water are watertight.  For parts of structures under water, when practical, place concrete seals continuously from start to finish.  Always keep the surface of the concrete as nearly horizontal as practical. To ensure thorough bonding, place each succeeding layer of a seal before the preceding layer has taken initial set.  Provide a tremie that includes a tube having a diameter of not less than 10 in., constructed in sections having flanged couplings fitted with gaskets.  Support the tremies to permit free movement of the discharge over the entire top surface of the work to permit rapid lowering  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-59     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  when necessary to retard or stop the flow of concrete.  Close the discharge end with a foot valve when work is initiated to prevent water from entering the tube.  Seal all joints so that  the concrete  may  be  discharged  into the  empty tube.   Ensure that the tremie  tube remains full to the bottom of the hopper.  When a batch is dumped into the hopper, induce the flow of concrete by slightly raising the discharge end but always keeping the flow in the  mass  of  placed  concrete.    Ensure  that  the  flow  is  continuous  until  the  work  is completed.  Do not proceed with dewatering until seven days after completion of the pour.  Perform the dewatering to comply with SECTION 208.  Remove all laitance or other unsatisfactory material  from  the  exposed  surface  by  scraping,  chipping,  or  other  means  so  that  the surface of the concrete will not be damaged.  g.  Concrete  Exposed  to  Sea  Water.    Do  not  place any  construction joints where  they  are  exposed to sea water.  h.  Cold Weather Concrete.  Ensure that concrete operations during cold weather conform to  Subsection 601.03.5.  i.  Hot Weather Concrete.  Ensure that concrete operations during hot weather conform to  Subsection 601.03.6.  Placing Concrete by Pumping (Optional Method).  a.  Pumping.    Placement  of  concrete  by  pumping  will  be  permitted  as  approved  by  the Engineer.  Arrange the equipment so that no vibrations result that might damage freshly placed concrete.  Ensure a pump operation that provides a continuous stream of concrete without  air  pockets.    When  pumping  is  completed,  eject  the  concrete  remaining  in  the pipeline,  if  such  will  be  used,  so  that  there  will  be  no  contamination  of  the  concrete  or separation of the ingredients.  b.  Handling  and  Placing  Concrete.    Place  concrete  to  avoid  segregation  of  materials  and displacement  of  reinforcement.    Before  the  placement  of  concrete,  the  Engineer  may require the Contractor to demonstrate the capability of the equipment to both convey the concrete  mixture  and  maintain  the  specified  quality.    No  further  verification  of  the equipment\u2019s  capability  will  be  required  unless  evidence  of  nonuniform  concrete  is observed by the Engineer during placement.  Do  not  allow  concrete  to  contact  aluminum  during  conveying  and  placing  operations. When concrete pumps are used, ensure that the lines have a minimum diameter of 5 in.  Keep all chutes, troughs, and pipes clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete by flushing with water after each run; properly dispose of water used for flushing clear of the concrete already in place.  Use a concrete washout to flush chutes, troughs, and pipes only.  Properly dispose of all other leftover concrete.  Do not drop concrete more than 5 ft or deposit a large quantity at any specific point and then run or work it along the forms.  800-60  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Fill each part of the form by depositing concrete directly in the form as close to its final position as practical; to work the coarser aggregates back from the face of the concrete; and  to  force  the  concrete  under  and  around  the reinforcement.    After the  concrete  has taken its initial set, avoid jarring the forms or placing any strain on the ends of projecting reinforcement.  c.  Design Mix.  As an option, submit for approval by the Engineer a pump mix design formula of  the  concrete  mixture  for  use  with  the  specific  pumping  equipment.    Ensure  that  the concrete mixture complies with Subsection 601.03.1.  d.  Placing  Concrete  Under  Water.    Place  concrete  under  water  continuously  from  start  to finish.  Keep the surface of the concrete as horizontal as practical.  To ensure bonding, place each succeeding layer of seal before the preceding layer has taken initial set.  For large  pours,  use  more  than  one  tremie  or  pump  to  ensure  compliance  with  this requirement.  Expansion, Contraction, and Construction Joints.  The following applies to concrete joints:  \u2022  General.  Joints may be filled or open.  Filled joints may be the poured type or filled with a premolded filler.  Subsection M02.10 specifies materials for joint fillers and sealants.  \u2022  Flashing and Water Stops.  Splice, weld, or solder metal flashing or flexible water stops to  form continuous watertight joints that conform to SECTION 812.  \u2022  Construction  Joints.    To  reduce  the  size  of  pours  or  for  other  construction  reasons,  additional joints may be provided at locations approved by the Engineer.  Ensure that all bonded construction joints obtain a bond between subsequent placements. Chip and clean all laitance and debris from the surface of the hardened concrete.  Clean the contact areas, moisten with water, and cover with a coating of mortar or neat cement grout.  Place the new concrete before the grout has attained its initial set and carefully spade into position.  Use shear keys, steel dowels, or inclined reinforcement approved by the Engineer where necessary to transmit shear or to bond the two sections together.  \u2022  Contraction  Joints.    Use  a  bond  breaker  material  approved  by  the  Engineer  with  contraction joints.  \u2022  Expansion  Joints.    Clean  joints  to  be  sealed  of  all  foreign  matter.    Apply  joint  fillers  according to Subsection 808.03.8.  Joint Fillers and Sealants.  For all the following, use a joint filler or sealant that is on the RIDOT Approved Materials List.  a.  Preformed Polyethylene Foam Joint Filler.  \u25cf  Preparation.  Ensure that joints are dry and cleaned of all deleterious material before  placing the joint fillers and sealants.  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-61       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Installation.    Install  the  preformed  joint  filler  according  to  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  b.  Polyurethane Joint Sealant.  \u25cf  Preparation.  Clean all joints of contaminants and impurities to the depth at which the sealant (and backer rod if detailed) will be installed.  Ensure that the operation provides a sound, clean, and frost-free surface for sealant application.  Blow out all dust, loose particles, and other debris with oil free compressed air.  Install  an  expanded  closed  cell  polyethylene  foam  rod  backup  material  in  joints,  or install an approved bond breaker tape if on the Plans.  \u25cf  Application.    Apply  a  primer  to  the  concrete  surfaces  of  the  joints.    Use  a  primer according to the recommendation of the sealant manufacturer and do not apply the primer to the backup rod or the bond breaker tape.  Apply  the  polyurethane  joint  sealant  in  conformance  with  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations  and, in  no  case, thicker than \u00bd  in.    Ensure  that  the  approximate width to depth ratio of 2:1 for working joints.  Tool the joint so that it is slightly concave.  A soap solution may be used as a tooling aid.  c.  Polyurethane Elastomeric Joint Sealant.  \u25cf  Preparation.    The  preparation  requirements  for  this  sealant  are  identical  to  those  specified above in Para. b.1 of this Subsection for Polyurethane Joint Sealant.  \u25cf  Application.    Apply  a  primer to the  concrete  surfaces  of  the joints.   Ensure  that the primer  is  according  to  the  recommendation  of  the  sealant  manufacturer  and  is  not applied to the backup rod or the bond breaker tape.  Apply  the  polyurethane  elastomeric  joint  sealant  according  to  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  Do not apply the sealant to joints less than \u00bc in. in width.  Provide an approximate width  to  depth  ratio  of  2:1  for  working  joints.    The  application  temperature  range  is 40\u00b0F to 100\u00b0F.  Tool the joint so that it is slightly concave.  A soap solution may be used as a tooling aid.  Clean up any spillage immediately according to local regulations and the directions of the Engineer.  d.  Silicone Joint Sealant.  Use silicone joint sealants, either on the AML or with the Engineer\u2019s approval, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  800-62  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Curing Concrete.  Ensure that Portland cement concrete is cured according to Subsection 601.03., except ensure that all placements designated as mass concrete meet the requirements of SECTION 607.  Removal of Forms, Falsework, and Centering.  In general, do not remove forms for slabs, beams, pier caps, and other support members until the concrete has reached the specified 28-day strength as indicated by the compression tests of field- cured cylinders fabricated and tested by the Contractor.  To facilitate finishing, side forms carrying no load may be removed after 24 hours if approved by the Engineer.  Continue the wet curing process for the remainder of the 14-day wet curing period at no additional cost to the Department.  The following Table presents the minimum strength requirements for the removal of formwork, placement of loads, and placement of backfill.  Structural Element  Subfoundation Concrete Cast-in-Place Concrete Piles Footing Abutment Wall, Rigid Frame Wall, and Box Culvert Wall Piers/Columns Drilled Shaft Above Grade Pile Cap and Pier Cap  Arch (Span \u2264 65 ft) (BF) Arch (Span \u2264 65 ft) (SF) Concrete Beam (BF) Concrete Beam (SF) Slab (Span \u2264 10 ft) and Diaphragms** Slab (Span > 10 ft)**  Bridge Decks Retaining Wall, Headwall, and Wingwall  Parapet Wall, Curb, and Backwall  Removal of Formwork  Placing Superimposed Vertical Dead Loads*  Placement of Backfill  Strength (%f\u2032c)  Strength (%f\u2032c)  Strength (%f\u2032c)  20 N/A 30  30  30 55 50  40 30 60 30 30 50  ***  30  20  30 50 40  50  50 60 60  95  80  85  85  30  20  20 N/A 30  95  N/A N/A 50  95  N/A  95  N/A  95  50  BF \u2013 bottom form                   SF \u2013 side form  *  Examples are placement of parapets on slabs, placement of walls on footings, and placement of beams on pier caps.  **   Slab includes slab type bridges, box culvert top slabs, rigid frame top slabs, approach slabs, moment  slabs, and sleeper slabs.  ***  Leave all forms in place without loosening for seven uninterrupted calendar days.  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-63       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Cure the Quality Control cylinders that are cast for the specific use as cylinder strength testing for form removal in the field under the same conditions as the placed structure concrete according to AASHTO T23/R100.  Test the cylinders to determine concrete strength before removing forms or placing loads on the concrete.  Do not strike falsework and centering for filled arches until fills behind the abutments have been placed up to the spring line.  Do not remove falsework supporting the deck of rigid frame structures until fills have been placed behind the vertical legs according to Subsection 203.03.5.  Gradually and uniformly lower centers to avoid excessive stresses in any part of the structure.  In arch structures of two or more spans, the sequence of striking centers will be specified by the Engineer.  Strike arch centering and ensure that the arch is self-supporting before the railing or coping is placed.  Concrete Finishes.  a.  General.  Ensure that finishes for concrete bridge decks placed by self-propelled machines conform  to  SECTION  814.    Otherwise,  apply  finishes  to  different  types  of  surfaces  as follows:  \u25cf  Float Finish.  Tops of walls, piers, abutments, parapets, safety walks, sidewalks, and  medians.  \u25cf  Rubbed Finish.  All exposed surfaces visible in elevation to 1 ft below final ground line  and the underside of concrete slabs outside of the fascia beam.  \u25cf  Bush-Hammered or Sand Blasted.  As shown on the Plans.  b.  Float Finish.  Achieve float finish for horizontal surfaces by placing excess concrete in the forms and striking it off with a template or screed, forcing the coarse aggregate below the surface.  Finish the surface with a wooden float to a smooth true plane.  Finish the area under bearing plates as practical to \u215b in. above the final elevation and then dressed to a uniform level bearing with a carborundum brick or power grinder after the concrete has sufficiently set.  c.  Rubbed Finish.  After the concrete has hardened, saturate the surface with water and rub using  a  medium-coarse carborundum  stone  with  a  small  quantity  of mortar  on  its  face. Approved bonding agents may be used.  Use  mortar  consisting  of  cement  and  fine  sand  in  the  same  proportions  used  in  the concrete  being  rubbed.    Continue  rubbing  until  all  form  marks,  projections,  and irregularities  are  removed,  all  voids  filled,  and  a  uniform  surface  is  obtained.  Keep  the paste  produced  by  rubbing  moist  and  allow  it  to set for  at  least five  days.   Smooth  the surface by rubbing with a fine carborundum stone and water.  Rub to produce a smooth texture and uniform color over the entire surface.  After the final rubbing is complete and the surface has dried, rub the entire surface with burlap to remove loose mortar.  Ensure  800-64  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  that the finished surface does not have unsound patches, paste, powder, or objectionable marks.  d.  Bushhammered or Sandblasted Finish.  Before finishing any concrete, cast a test panel approximately  4  ft  \u00d7  4  ft  in  a  vertical  position  with  a  joint  in  the  form  work  near approximately  the  middle  of  the  panel  and  demonstrate  the  proposed  method.    This method  will  be  approved  by  the  Engineer  before  use.    If  the  first  trial  panel  does  not produce  satisfactory  results,  cast  one  or  more  trial  panels  until  a  satisfactory  finish  is obtained.  Cure the surfaces to be finished.  After the forms have been removed, patch all holes with an  approved  mortar  that  complies  with  Subsection  M04.03.5,  and  remove  any  fins  or other protuberances to present a roughly even surface.  Do not initiate any finishing until the concrete has attained its specified 28-day strength.  When finishing bevels or corners, do not damage the lines.  After the surfaces are finished, remove all dust and loose particles by brushing with stiff wire brushes or air blasting.  e.  Concrete  Architectural  Treatment  Form  Liner  Finish.    The  architectural  treatment  is achieved using form liners.  Use form liners that are attached to the concrete formwork and are of the single-use type from the same manufacturer.  Provide evidence to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the products and their installation have been successfully used in similar applications.  Before construction, present a sample panel to the Engineer that includes a butt joint to ensure that the form liner panels produce a consistent surface pattern and appearance without visible seams.  Provide a sample panel that has a minimum size of 5 sq ft.  Submit  Shop  Drawings  for  the  concrete  architectural  treatment  system  according  to Subsection  105.02.    The  Engineer  will  review  the  Shop  Drawings  and  samples  for compliance with the specifications.  Apply the concrete architectural treatment to the exterior face of concrete surfaces within the required limits to a minimum of 1 ft below the finished grade.  Apply form liners per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and according to the following provisions:  \u25cf  Mate form liners with the adjacent panels to produce a consistent pattern, and place adjacent liners to each other with a \u215b-in. seam or less.  Attach the form liners to the forms  per  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.   Coordinate  wall  ties  with  the  form liner system.  \u25cf  Ensure that form liners are rigid and capable of withstanding the anticipated concrete placement pressures without leakage, which could cause physical or visual defects, and  are  able  to  be  removed  without  causing  concrete  surface  deterioration  or weakness in the substrate.  Ensure that form release agents, form stripping methods, patching  materials,  and  related  construction  materials  are  compatible  with  all  other elements of concrete architectural treatment.  SECTION 808 \u2014 CAST-IN-PLACE STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-65     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Blend form liner butt joints into the approved pattern.  Ensure that no visible vertical or horizontal seams or conspicuous form marks are created by butt-joined form liners. Ensure  that  the  finished  concrete  surface  has  the  required  finished  texture  and continuous pattern.  \u25cf  The Engineer must approve the use of wall ties that result in a portion of the tie being permanently embedded in the concrete before initiating work.  Provide wall ties with break setbacks of 1 in. minimum from the finished concrete surface.  Place the wall tie holes in the high point of the rustication or mortar joint.  Fill any voids left from snapped off wall ties with an approved color matching mortar patch.  \u25cf  Place  concrete  according  to  Subsection  808.03.5  with  an  emphasis  on  the  proper vibration of the concrete next to the form liner to ensure that no honeycombs or other deficiencies occur in the face of the concrete.  \u25cf  After stripping the forms and form liners, clean the concrete surface to ensure that it is free  of  all  laitance,  dirt,  dust,  grease,  release  agents,  efflorescence,  and  any  other foreign or deleterious materials.  \u25cf  Do not use sandblasting to clean concrete surfaces; use pressure washing with water for  removing  laitance.    When  pressure  washing  will  be  used,  perform  the  work according to SECTION 815.  Ensure that the completed surface is free of blemishes, discolorations,  surface  voids  greater  than  \u215c  in.  in  diameter,  and  conspicuous  form marks.    Ensure  that  the  cleaning  process  does  not  diminish  the  rustic  appearance created  by  the  form  liner.    Ensure  that  inlet  protection  is  in  place  and  properly maintained.  Provide  materials  that  are  prepared,  applied,  cured,  and  stored  according  to  the product manufacturers\u2019 directions.  When directed by the Engineer, provide the manufacturer\u2019s technical representatives to  answer  questions  and/or  make  recommendations  before  and  during  the  work operations.  808.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Structure Concrete Masonry will be measured by the number of cubic yards of concrete provided.  808.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.

Void-Producing Forms.  Construct void-producing forms with a waterproof material and with a 1-in. diameter vent located at each end of the void.  Vent all voids after removing the concrete element from the form.  Prestressing Steel.  Before installation in the units, ensure that the prestressing steel is free of rust, frost, dirt, oil, paint, corrosion, or any foreign material that may prevent bonding between the steel and the concrete. The  Engineer  will  reject  any  prestressing  steel  that  has  sustained  physical  damage.    The development of pitting or corrosion impacts (other than rust stain) will be cause for rejection as determined by the Engineer.  Examine prestressing steel that is exhibiting rust stains before its placement  in  the  forms  to  determine  if  pitting  exists.    Replace  any  coil  that  contains  broken prestressing or post tensioning steel strands.  Do not splice prestressing steel strands inside the casting form.  Splicing of strands outside the casting form may be allowed only with prior written approval of the Engineer.  Do not tack weld the bar reinforcement.  Place and fasten all steel reinforcement according to Subsection 810.03.5.  Furnish a manufacturer\u2019s Certificate of Compliance and a mill test report per size, heat number, source, and load for all prestressing steel strands.  The Engineer may obtain strand steel samples for verification testing.  SECTION 809 \u2014 PRECAST/PRESTRESSED STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-71      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  See SECTION 810 for reinforcing steel.  Tensioning of Prestressing Strands.  Tension  the  prestressing  elements  to  provide  the  required  prestress  to  conform  to  the  current edition of PCI MNL 116.  Ensure  that  all  strands  of  a  prestressed  member  are  free  from  kinks  or  twists  before  initiating tensioning  operations.    Do  not  allow  any  unwinding  of  the  strand  in  excess  of  one  turn  after tensioning operations are begun.  Ensure that all strands are tensioned to 20 percent of the final jacking force before elongation readings are started.  Ensure that the equipment for producing the initial tensioning load provides a means for accurately measuring the force.  When the initial tensioning load is applied by pressure jacks, equip the jack with a proper gauging system for the initial force.  Apply  the  pre-designated  initial  force  to  each  strand.    Use  this  load  as  the  starting  point  for measuring additional tensioning for tension determination by the elongation method.  When comparing theoretical gauge and actual gauge readings, and theoretical elongations and actual elongations, comply with the requirements of the currently adopted edition of PCI MNL 116.  In the elongation computation, account for strand anchorage slippage, horizontal movement of abutments,  bed  shortening,  and  any  change  in  temperature  of  the  prestressing  steel  between tensioning and the time when concrete takes its initial set, if the change is expected to exceed 30\u00b0F.  Do not perform the final pretensioning at temperatures below 20\u00b0F.  Stress the draped strands no higher than the required design stress minus the stress increase in the strand from forcing it into a draped profile.  If the strands are tensioned in their draped position, support the strands by rollers at each point of change in direction.  Ensure that the holdup rollers between members and at the ends of the members  have  either  bronze  bushings  or  roller  bearings  that  are  free  running  and  kept  well lubricated.  Ensure that rollers at the hold-down points are free running and of a type that produces a  minimum  amount  of  friction.    If  the  load  for  a  draped  strand,  as  determined  by  elongation measurements, exceeds 5 percent less than that indicated by the jack gauges, tension the strand from both ends of the bed.  Ensure that the load as computed from the sum of elongation at both ends agrees within 5 percent of that indicated by jack gauges.  There may be a discrepancy in the indicated stress between jack gauge pressure and elongation. If yes, ensure that the load used produces a slight overstress rather than understress.  When a discrepancy between gauge and elongation measurements of more than 5 percent occurs, check the entire operation and determine and correct the source of error before proceeding further.  The Engineer may require the use of a load cell to check the applied load.  Calibrate the load cell at least once every six months or more frequently when deemed necessary by the Engineer.  Check prestressing steel strands in pretensioned members, if tensioned individually or in groups, for loss of prestress not more than three hours before placing concrete.  The Engineer will approve the method and equipment for checking the loss of prestress.  Retension all strands that show a relaxation loss of prestress in excess of 3 percent to the designed final jacking force.  800-72  SECTION 809 \u2014 PRECAST/PRESTRESSED STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  When stressing grouped strands simultaneously, first bring each tendon to initial tensioning load. Apply the final tensioning load to the group using a procedure approved by the Engineer.  During tensioning of any strand, conduct the process so that the applied load and the elongation of the strand may be measured at all times.  Check any prestressed strand that has been tensioned for over 48 hours without the placement of concrete for elongation or loss of stress before placing concrete.  If losses occur, detension the strands and then retension according to the design loading requirements.  Handling and Placing Concrete.  Do  not  place  concrete  without  the  Engineer\u2019s  written  approval.    Handle  and  place  concrete according to SECTIONS 601 and 808.  Convey and place concrete without segregation.  Do not drop the concrete mixture from a height greater than one foot above the top of the forms.  Deposit the concrete in its final position in each part of the form.  Consolidate the fresh concrete in place according to PCI MNL 116 Division 4.17.  Finishing.  After  all  concrete  has  been  placed  and  compacted  as  required  under  Subsection  809.03.6, magnesium  float  finish  the  tops  of  units.    To  ensure  production  of  well-formed  concrete elements  with  an  overall  pleasing  appearance,  ensure  that  all  concrete  surfaces  are  true  and even  and  free  from  rough,  open,  or  honeycombed  areas,  depressions,  air  pockets,  or projections.    Finish  all exposed surfaces by bagging or as otherwise indicated.  Curing.  Ensure that curing conforms to PCI MNL 116, Divisions 4.18, 4.19, and 4.20.  Cure  precast  concrete  members  for  not  less  than  seven  days  in  conformance  with  the  water method, steam curing, or radiant heat at the option of the Contractor.  Ensure that steam curing for precast members conforms to the following provisions:  \u2022 After  placement  of  the  concrete,  hold  members  for  a  minimum  four-hour  presteaming period.  If the ambient air temperature is below 50\u00b0F, apply steam during the presteaming period to hold the air surrounding the member at a temperature between 50\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F.  \u2022 To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces during the presteaming period, cover the members as soon as possible after casting, or keep the exposed surfaces wet by fog spray or wet blankets.  \u2022 Allow  enclosures  for  steam  curing  free  circulation  of  steam  about  the  member,  and construct the enclosure to contain the live steam with a minimum moisture loss.  The use of tarpaulins or similar flexible covers will be permitted, if the covers remain in good repair and are secured to prevent the loss of steam and moisture.  SECTION 809 \u2014 PRECAST/PRESTRESSED STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-73  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u2022 Ensure that steam at the jets is low pressure and in a saturated condition.  Do not permit steam jets to impinge directly on the concrete, test cylinders, or forms.  During application of the steam, ensure that the temperature rise within the enclosure does not exceed 40\u00b0F per hour.  Ensure that the curing temperature throughout the enclosure does not exceed 150\u00b0F and is maintained at a constant level for a sufficient time necessary to develop the required transfer strength.  Cover control cylinders to prevent moisture loss, and place the cylinders  where  temperature  is  representative  of  the  average  temperature  of  the enclosure.  \u2022 Provide calibrated temperature recording devices that will provide an accurate continuous permanent  record  of  the  curing  temperature.    Use  a  minimum  of  one  temperature recording device per 100 ft of continuous bed length for checking the temperature.  \u2022 Once  the  minimum  transfer  compressive  strength  is  achieved,  detension  members  in tension immediately after the termination of steam curing while the concrete and forms are still warm, and ensure that the temperature under the enclosure maintains above 60OF until the stress is transferred to the concrete.  \u2022 The  initial  curing  of  precast  concrete  will  be  considered  complete  once  the  specified  transfer strength is verified by compressive strength test results.  \u2022 Radiant heat may be applied by pipes circulating steam, hot oil or hot water, or electric heating elements.  Perform radiant heat curing under a suitable enclosure to contain the heat and moisture loss, and minimize heat loss by covering all exposed concrete surfaces with plastic sheeting.  If the Contractor proposes to cure by any other method, the Engineer must approve the method and its details.  Testing.  a. General.    Ensure  that  Acceptance,  Contractor  Quality  Control,  and  Independent  Assurance sampling and testing conforms to SECTION 601, as modified herein.  b. Quality Control Testing.  Perform mandatory Quality Control Testing of concrete according  to SECTION 601 and according to the following provisions:  \u25cf Field  cure  the  Quality  Control  cylinders  under  the  same  curing  conditions  as  the precast/prestressed  element.    Furnish  the  cylinder  molds  for  all  compressive  test specimens.  \u25cf Cast Quality Control cylinders and test in the presence of the Engineer.  \u25cf Place all cylinders within 15 ft of each end of the casting bed or as determined by the  Engineer.  \u25cf Test one cylinder from each location in immediate succession to verify form stripping  (precast), stress transfer (prestressed), and 28-day strengths (shipping).  800-74  SECTION 809 \u2014 PRECAST/PRESTRESSED STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Do not ship any structure from the plant to the Project site unless it has obtained the minimum  28-day  compressive  strength.    Do  not  ship  without  the  RIDOT  Materials inspection stamp or other documented approval by the Engineer.  c.  Acceptance Testing.  Only the Engineer performs Acceptance testing.  Transfer of Prestress.  Accomplish  the  transfer  of  prestress  in  the  presence  of  the  Engineer  and  according  to  the approved detensioning schedule and as soon as the transfer strength is achieved and verified. Provide a detensioning schedule that includes the following:  \u2022  The order of detensioning \u2022  A provision that each strand is detensioned at each end and/or between each element  At the end of each prestressed element, chip back the concrete surrounding the individual strands to sound material to a depth of between \u00be in. to 1 in.  Cut back the strands to the same depth. Square off the edges to avoid producing a feathered edge.  Remove all dirt and residue that is not firmly bonded to the metal or concrete surfaces.  Fill the ensuing void, including the end of the strand, with an approved non-shrink grout.  Finish the surface to be flush with that of the plane surface of the product.  Handling.  Remove all products from the forms in the presence of the Engineer.  Provide adequate notice to the  Engineer  to  allow  witnessing  of  the  removal  operation.    Ensure  that  precast/prestressed members are not damaged during handling and moving.  Transport precast girders and slabs in an upright position.  Ensure that the points of support and direction of the reactions with respect to  the  member  are  approximately  the  same  during  transportation  and  storage  as  when  the member is in its final position.  Ensure that the storage, hoisting, and handling of the precast units prevents cracking or damage. Repairs must be approved by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.  Rejection of Units.  The Engineer will make a preliminary determination on whether spalled, cracked, honeycombed, or  otherwise  defective  concrete must  be  repaired  or  be  subject  to rejection.    If  the  unit  will  be repaired,  submit  a  detailed  non-conformance  report  and  a  detailed  repair  procedure  to  the Engineer for approval in writing before commencement of the repair work.  Perform  all  repair  work  at  no  additional  cost  to  the  Department  and  in  the  presence  of  the Engineer.  The Engineer will not accept any repair work not performed in his/her presence.  The Engineer will reinspect the repaired unit.

Ensure that the dimensions of hooks and the diameters of bends comply with the latest edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications or ACI 318, \u201cBuilding Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete.\u201d  c.  Identification.  Furnish bar reinforcement shipped in standard bundles, tagged and marked according to the Manual of Standard Practice of the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI).  Handling, Storage, and Surface Condition of Reinforcement.  a. Uncoated  Bars.    Store  all  reinforcement  bar,  wire,  or  fabric  above  the  ground  on  sills, blocking,  or  other  supports  immediately  when  unloaded,  and  protect  from  mechanical injury or corrosion causing conditions.  SECTION 810 \u2014 REINFORCING STEEL  800-77  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Ensure that all reinforcement is free from dirt, loose rust or scale, mortar, paint, grease, oil, and other materials that could reduce bond, immediately before placement of concrete. Thoroughly  hand-wire  brush  all  rusted  areas  just  before  installation.    After  hand-wire brushing, the remaining  rusted  areas  are  acceptable  if  the  minimum  dimensions,  cross sectional  area,  and  tensile  properties  meet  the  physical  requirements  for  the  size  and grade of steel specified.  b.  Galvanized Bars. In addition to the above requirements for uncoated bars, the following  apply to galvanized bars:  \u25cf  Use acceptable methods for handling galvanized bars that have padded contact areas  for the bars.  \u25cf  Use padded bundling bands and lift bundles with a strongback, multiple supports, or a platform bridge to prevent bar-to-bar abrasion from sags in the bar bundle.  Do not drop or drag bars or bundles.  Provide galvanized bars without visible white oxide or other surface contaminants of the zinc  at  the  time  of  concrete  placement.    Bar  that  has  white  oxide  or  other  surface contaminants may be cleaned by methods selected by the Contractor, if the methods do not compromise  the  zinc  coating  protection,  including  causing  any reduction  of the  film thickness below the minimum specification limit.  Placing and Fastening.  a.  Uncoated  Bars.    Carefully  check  all  bar  lists  and  assume  full  responsibility  for  their accuracy before ordering bar reinforcement.  Ensure that the steel reinforcement is held in place during the placing and setting of concrete.  Ensure that reinforcement is free from dirt, rust, loose mill scale, paint, oil, and other foreign deleterious materials when placed in the work.  The following apply:  \u25cf  Spacing and Cover.  Ensure that the required spacing and cover of reinforcement is  met.  \u25cf  Support  Systems.    Maintain  bars  at  the  correct  distance  from  the  forms  by  using blocks, hangers, chairs, or other approved devices.  Do not use pieces of stone, brick, wood, or metal pipe.  If required, precast concrete blocks placed with the small face down  may  be  used.    Furnish  metallic  support  systems  with  a  protective  coating  for corrosion protection.  Install plastic tips on metallic support hardware resting against formwork.  \u25cf  Fastening.  Before the concrete is placed, securely fasten together all reinforcement and support with approved chairs or other approved devices.  Ensure that chairs are properly  sized  and  spaced  to  provide  the  specified  minimum  concrete  clear  cover. Securely tie bars with wire at all intersections around the perimeter of each mat and within the interior at not less than 2-ft centers or at every intersection, whichever is greater.    Tie  bundled  bars  together  at  not  more  than  6-ft  centers.    Tie  a  sufficient number of intersections to prevent any movement of the mat or loose bars.  800-78  SECTION 810 \u2014 REINFORCING STEEL      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Use plastic coated metallic wire ties and miscellaneous metallic hardware.  Use plastic tips on metallic hardware resting against formwork.  Ensure that all reinforcement has been placed and tied, inspected, and approved by the Engineer in writing before placement of concrete.  \u25cf Splicing  Reinforcing  Steel.    Furnish  full  length reinforcement  bars.    Splicing  of  bars and wire fabric reinforcing is not permitted without the written approval of the Engineer. When allowed, stagger splices as far as possible.  Ensure that splices do not reduce the concrete clear cover.  The following also apply:  \u25cb  Lap Splices.  Use only mechanical splices for splices of bars greater than No. 11. The length of each lap splice must conform to the Plans for tension or compression splices.  Place the bars in contact and wire them together for the full lap length of the splice.  \u25cb Mechanical  Splices.    Mechanical  splices  will  be  approved  in  writing  by  the Engineer.  Ensure that the splices develop at least 125 percent of the specified yield strength of the bar being spliced, in tension or compression.

This  work  includes  the  placement  of  concrete  bridge  decks  by  using  self-propelled  finishing machines.  814.02  MATERIALS.  Provide materials for all Portland cement concrete mixes that conform to SECTION 601.  814.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  General.  Provide all equipment, tools, and requirements pertaining to the classification, proportioning, and testing  for  the  specified class  of concrete,  including  batching, mixing,  handling,  placing,  curing and finishing, that conform to SECTIONS 601, 808, and 816, as modified in this Section.  Contractor\u2019s Plan.  Before the start of placing the concrete bridge deck, submit a Shop Drawing to the Engineer for approval for a Placement and Curing Plan specifying the:  \u2022  Method of concrete conveyance, placement, type, and number of finishing machines \u2022  Rate of pour \u2022  Estimated time of completion \u2022  Screed and rail erection plan* \u2022  Sequence of concrete pours \u2022  Concrete curing procedure  *  Ensure that the screed and rail placement are compatible with the deck being finished full width by the finishing machine.  Design the support brackets to support the deck finishing machine and screed rails.  The  Placement  and  Curing  Plan  shall  be  prepared  and  stamped  by  a  Rhode  Island  licensed Professional Engineer.  Ensure  that  the  Placement  and  Curing  Plan  considers  weather  conditions  and  that  the  Plan includes  the  details  and  a  complete  description  of  equipment  to  be  used  in  the  handling, placement, finishing, and curing the concrete, including the number and type of personnel who will  be  engaged  in  the  operation.    Approval  of  this  Plan  does  not  relieve the  Contractor  of the responsibility for the satisfactory performance of the methods and equipment.  Base the elevations for setting forms and screed supports on a set of computations but located no more than 10 ft apart.  Before placing the concrete, make all necessary arrangements and have  all  materials  on  hand  for  curing  and  protecting  the  concrete  deck.    Do  not  proceed  with concrete  placement  until the  Engineer  is satisfied that  all  necessary  steps  have  been taken to  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS  800-89        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  ensure compliance with the Contract and that completion of the operation can be accomplished within the required scheduled time.  Allow sufficient time to permit inspection by the Engineer.  Limitation of Mixing.  a.  Temperature and Weather Conditions.  Ensure that all weather and concrete temperature  requirements meet Subsection 601.03.4 except as modified herein.  Do  not  place  the  bridge deck  concrete  when the  relative  humidity  is  below  35  percent. When  placing  concrete,  provide  suitable  equipment  and  take  appropriate  actions  as approved by the Engineer to limit the evaporation rate of the exposed concrete surface to less than 0.15 lb/sq-ft/hr.  Determine the evaporation rate according to Figure 1 below.  To maintain the evaporation rate below the specified limit, mist the surface of the concrete with  a triple  head  nozzle  immediately  behind  the  finishing machine  and until  the  curing cover is applied.  Rate the nozzle at one gallon per minute or less, and ensure that this produces a fine, fog mist that will maintain a sheen of moisture on the concrete surface without ponding.  b.  Hot  Weather  Concrete.    During  hot  weather  conditions,  ensure  that  the  concrete  temperature at time of placement conforms to Subsection 601.03.6.  c.  Cold  Weather  Concrete.    During  cold  weather  conditions,  ensure  that  the  concrete  temperature at the time of placement conforms to Subsection 601.03.5.  d.  Inclement Weather.  When rain or snow is imminent, protect all new concrete to prevent damage  that  may  result  in  surface  imperfections  of  the  deck.    Ensure  that  sufficient polyethylene coverings conforming to Subsection M02.04.2 are available at the site of the work for possible immediate use.  Handling.  Before concrete placement, ensure that all forms are clean and free of rust, excessive oils, and any  foreign  debris.    The  Engineer  will  inspect  all  concrete  forms  and  materials  such  as  shear connectors, dams, ductwork, spacers, rebars, and any other required materials before concreting operations commence.  Do not weld the forming attachments nor other construction aids to tension flanges.  Place  concrete  continuously  without  interruption  between  planned  construction  or  expansion joints.  800-90  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Figure 1  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS  800-91      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Concrete Placement Sequence.  a.  Simple Spans.  Ensure that concrete bridge deck placement progresses continuously over the  entire  width  and  for  the  full  length  of  the  bridge.    Begin  deck  placement  at  the expansion end of the span and terminate at the fixed end.  Transverse construction joints are not permitted.  b.  Continuous  Spans.    Ensure  that  concrete  placement  complies  with  the  concrete  deck placement  sequence  specified  in  the  Contract  Plans.  The  Engineer  must  approve  any deviations.  Place all concrete between consecutive joints in a continuous operation.  The first pour includes the positive moment area in all spans.  The second pour includes the negative moment area and is not placed until a minimum of 72 hours have elapsed from initiation of the first pour.  Placement.  Except as modified herein, ensure that concrete placement conforms to Subsections 808.03.5 and 808.03.6.  Attain a rate of placement so that the concrete is finished before the beginning of initial set.  Maintain a minimum rate of placement of 35 cu yd/hr at each finishing machine.  Before  concrete  placement  operations  begin,  shape  substantial  bulkheads  or  headers  to  the required deck surface cross section.  If unforeseen circumstances force the concrete placement to  cease,  install  sufficient  bulkheads  at  locations  determined  by  the  Engineer  and  discontinue concrete  placement.    Remove  all  concrete  beyond  the  bulkhead.    Concrete  placement  will recommence only with the approval of the Engineer.  Place the concrete as a monolithic unit in a continuous operation between joints.  Consolidate the concrete by a high frequency internal vibrator that is applied to secure maximum consolidation  of  the  concrete.    Ensure  that  consolidation  yields  concrete  free  from  voids  and ensures a dense surface texture, but is not continued so long to cause segregation or bleeding. Maintain a small uniform quantity of concrete ahead of the screed on each pass.  Do not allow the quantity of concrete carried ahead of the screed to be so great to cause slipping or lifting.  Where the vibratory action of the finishing machine does not provide consolidation according to the rate of placement, have in reserve sufficient vibration equipment to guard against shutdown of the work.  Ensure that the reinforcement is not susceptible to damage by the vibrators.  Finishing.  Use methods, procedures, and equipment that will ensure a uniform riding surface without over- vibration or segregation of the concrete components.  Maintain the leading edge of freshly placed concrete approximately parallel to the finishing machine.  a.  Finishing Machine.  Use an approved self-propelled finishing machine(s) for consolidating, striking off, and finishing the concrete deck surface.  Provide a finishing machine(s) that has  sufficient  width  to  finish  the  full  width  of  the  deck.    Ensure  that  the  weight  of  the finishing machine(s) does not cause unaccounted for deflection of the bridge members or falsework.  Ensure that the machine travels on steel rails, pipe, or other approved grade control,  which  will  be  supported  by  vertical  supports  securely  fastened  in  place  at  a maximum  spacing  of  2  ft  to  prevent  any  appreciable  deflection  between  rail  supports.  800-92  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Before placing the concrete, ensure that all screed rails are in place and accurately set to ensure finishing of the concrete deck surface to the required elevations.  Provide supports for  rails,  if  embedded  in the  deck  concrete,  that can  be removed  without  disturbing the concrete.  Do not treat screed rails with form-release compound to facilitate their removal. Extend rails for finishing machines beyond both ends of the scheduled length for concrete placement.  Ensure that the extended length is a sufficient distance to allow the finishing machine(s) to clear the concrete to be placed.  Provide a finishing machine that can propel itself both forward and backward to enable repeated passes to correct surface irregularities and to produce a surface that conforms to the required profile grade, cross section, and surface smoothness.  A maximum of two passes of the machine will be allowed over any given deck area.  Operate the finishing machine(s) over the full length of the bridge segment to be finished before beginning concrete operations.  Conduct a test run with the screed adjusted to its finishing position.  During the test run, check the deflection due to the finishing machine, adjustment of guide rails, and required cover for slab reinforcement.  Check the required concrete cover over the top bars by riding the screed over the bars and measuring the cover over the slab reinforcement.  Rectify discrepancies that are in excess of the allowed tolerances to secure the required concrete cover.  Make all necessary corrections before concreting is begun.  Coordinate  concrete  placement  and  initial  strike-off  so  that  the  initial  strike-off  is  never more than 10 ft behind the concrete placement.  Make sufficient depth checks behind the machine(s) and along the full length of the span to ensure that the required section and reinforcement cover are provided.  On skewed bridge decks, ensure that the placement of the concrete and the operation of the finishing machine is parallel to the skew angle.  Correct  improper  adjustment  or  operation  of  the  finishing  machine  that  results  in inadequate reinforcement cover or smoothness.  Unsatisfactory performance, particularly with  respect  to  the  surface  smoothness  attained,  may  be  cause  for  rejection  of  the equipment.  b.  Work Bridge.  Provide an adequate number of work bridges to permit access to the deck surface  to  allow  finishing,  straight-edging,  making  corrections,  and  setting  curing materials.  Do not permit workmen to walk in the fresh concrete after it has been screeded. Perform all finishing work, including application of the fog spray and placement of curing mats, from work that bridges support above the deck surface.  c.  Tolerances.  Verify that the completed surface of the deck meets the required grades and cross slope both during placement and after the deck has been cured.  When the concrete is still plastic, use a 10-ft straightedge to test the deck surface and correct any variance in excess of \u215b-in. in 10 ft.  If this tolerance is not met when tested after the concrete has hardened,  correct  any  variance  in  excess  of  \u215b-in.  in  10  ft  at  no  additional  cost  to  the Department.  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS  800-93      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Curing.  In the Placement and Curing Plan, include the following details for curing the concrete.  a.  Detailed Plan.  Provide a Plan that includes the following:  \u25cf  Curing method \u25cf  Provisions for enclosures, indicating method of holding down enclosure safely in place \u25cf  Heat devices, types, and locations around structure \u25cf  Method of monitoring temperature of hardened concrete \u25cf  Backup systems as required  b.  Curing Operations.  Immediately following the finishing operation, initiate the application of  a  water  fog  spray  and  apply  continuously  until  the  moist  covers  are  placed  on  the concrete surface.  Continue fog spraying to provide a continuous supply of moisture to maintain a thoroughly moist concrete surface.  As soon as concrete finishing operations are completed, promptly cover the newly placed concrete surface with a single layer of clean, heavy duty, water-saturated burlap conforming to Subsection M02.04.1.  Ensure that  the  burlap  is  free  from  cuts,  tears,  uneven  weaving,  and  contaminants.    Place  the burlap  so  that  the  edges  are  lapped  a  minimum  of  6  in.    Place  a  4-mil  clear  or  white polyethylene sheet conforming to Subsection M02.04.2 over the saturated burlap cover.  White  plastic-coated  fiber  blankets  conforming  to  Subsection  M02.04.2  may  be  used. Comply with the placement requirements for the burlap edge lapping specification.  Do not apply curing compounds in lieu of fog spray and the moist cure process.  Ensure that all concrete remains continuously moist and protected against any drying for a minimum period of 14 consecutive days after placement of concrete.  Ensure that the burlap covers remain moist for the entire 14-day curing period.  Do not allow the concrete to be exposed to an alternating wet and dry condition.  If at any time during the curing period the surface of the concrete deck is judged to be losing  excessive  moisture  that  adversely  affects  the  curing  process,  the  Engineer  may require that the polyethylene sheets be removed and the coverings be saturated.  Then recover the saturated coverings with polyethylene sheets.  If forms or sections of forms have been loosened and/or removed in advance of the curing period, immediately cover the exposed concrete surface with saturated curing covers and keep the concrete saturated for the remainder of the curing period.  c.  Falling  Temperatures.  Provide  suitable  measures  to  maintain  the  concrete  surface temperature  at  a  minimum  of  50\u00b0F,  and  monitor  the  temperature  by  a  continuously recording  thermometer.    Continuously  maintain  the  minimum  50\u00b0F  temperature  around the  forms  and  deposited  concrete  for  seven  days  after  concrete  placement  and  above 40\u00b0F for the remaining seven days of the curing period.  If, during the curing period, the concrete surface temperatures fall below the temperatures outlined in the paragraph above, enclose the structure and provide external heat.  Always have  the  required  heating  measures  ready  on  short  notice  during  the  curing  period.    If external heat is required, the following applies:  800-94  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Do not count the time required for tenting as curing time.  \u25cf  Maintain external heat on the structure for the first seven days of the curing period. For the next seven days, gradually reduce the external heat so that the uniform change in  temperature  does  not  exceed  5\u00b0F  in  one  hour  nor  exceed  50\u00b0F  (while  still maintaining the minimum temperatures stated above) in any 24-hour period.  Remove forms as specified in Subsection 808.03.10.  If  during the  curing  period  the  concrete surface temperature falls  below 35\u00b0F, concrete may be rejected if the surface temperature falls below 35\u00b0F during the curing period.  Take precautions to protect the concrete deck from damage resulting from severe weather conditions during the curing process.  d.  Quality Control Test Cylinders.  Fabricate Quality Control test cylinders on all bridge deck placements.    Field  cure  all  Quality  Control  test  cylinders  with  the  concrete  deck  under identical curing conditions according to AASHTO T23 / R100.  Final Finish.  Comply with the following for the final finish:  a.  Bridge  Decks  with  Exposed  Concrete  Surfaces.    For  the  final  concrete  surface  finish,  perform the saw cut grooving before the installation of expansion joint systems.  \u25cf  Equipment.  Ensure that the equipment has a positive means of removing the saw cut grooving  residue  from  the  deck  surface  leaving  the  surface  in  a  clean,  near  dry condition.  \u25cf  Surface  Preparation  \u2013  Disposal  of  Construction  Debris.    Before  initiation  of  work, submit a debris handling and management plan indicating quantities of residue that are expected to be generated, locations for temporary storage for drying or settling of fines and, if necessary, the location acquired or designated for disposal of residue.  \u25cf  Disposal.    Manage  and  legally  dispose  of  all  debris  from  the  saw  cutting  operation  consistent with applicable health and safety regulations.  \u25cf  Construction  Methods.    Ensure  that  the  entire  bridge  deck  area  receives  saw  cut grooving.  Perform saw cut grooving to the deck surface while providing positive lateral drainage  by  maintaining  a  constant  cross  slope  between  saw  cutting  extremities  in each lane.  Apply a saw cut grooved finish to concrete wearing surfaces.  Perform this work using a multi-bladed diamond wet saw with circular saw blades.  The Engineer may allow the use of a single blade, circular saw tool, where it is determined that this equipment is necessary to complete the work.  The Engineer will approve the proposed equipment before the work is initiated.  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS  800-95      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Saw  cutting  may  begin  only  after  the  specified  curing  period  has  elapsed.    Cut  all grooves in a rectangular shape conforming to the following dimensions:  \u25cb  Width:  \u215b in. \u00b11/32 in. \u25cb  Depth: \u00bc in. \u00b11/16 in.  Terminate  grooves  4  in.  to  12  in.  away  from  curbs,  parapets,  drainage  structures, bridge joints, medians, and exposed edges of the structural concrete slab.  During the grooving operations, the Engineer will verify, at random, that the minimum grooved depth is being achieved.  If not, then stop grooving operations and make all necessary  adjustments,  and  any  repairs,  as  required  by  the  Engineer.    At  each location, a minimum of five depth measurements will be taken and the average depth determined.  If the average depth is outside the specified depth limits, two additional measurements  will  be  conducted  in  the  vicinity  to  ascertain  non-compliance  (i.e., consistently too shallow or too deep).  Areas that do not meet the specified minimum groove depth will be subject to corrective action by the Contractor.  Areas that exceed the  specified  maximum  groove  depth  will  be  subject  to  a  price  adjustment  of  a 1-percent reduction of the concrete cost for that area of diamond grooving performed that day.  Supply the Engineer with two accurate, easily readable, gauges with which to verify groove depth.  Deliver the gauges and the applicable manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use no later than seven days before the anticipated start of grooving operations.  Do not allow slurry or debris from the grooving operation to accumulate or harden, and prevent  the  slurry  from  flowing  into  drains,  onto  the  roadway  slopes,  or  into  water bodies below or adjacent to the bridge.  Remove residue continuously and dispose of the slurry or debris properly.  Only use rubber-tired vehicles on the bridge deck after saw cut grooving.  Saw cut grooves may be either transverse or longitudinal as follows as specified on the Plans:  \u25cb  Transverse  Saw  Cut  Grooves.    Cut  transverse  grooves  perpendicular  to  the centerline  of  the  roadway  using  a  single  pass.    Ensure  that  the  grooves  are randomly  spaced,  ranging  from  1\u00bc  in.  to  2  in.,  with  50  percent  of  the  spacings being less than or equal to 1\u00bd in.  Submit a spacing pattern to the Engineer for approval.  An example of an acceptable random pattern is 1\u00bc, 1\u00bd, 1\u215c, 1\u00bc, 1\u00be, 1\u00bd, 2, 2, 1\u00bd,  1\u00bc,  1\u215c,  2,  1\u215d,  1\u00bc,  1\u00bd,  1\u00bd,  1\u00be,  2,  and  1\u215d,  with  all  spaces  measured  in inches.  Do not base spacings solely on multiples of \u00bc in., because the result will not be truly random (e.g., do not use a pattern such as 1\u00bc, 1\u00bc, 1\u00be, 2, 1\u00bd, 2, 2, etc.).  \u25cb  Longitudinal  Saw  Cut  Grooves.    Cut  longitudinal  grooves  parallel  to  the  bridge centerline,  or  working  line,  using  continuous  passes.    On  curved  alignments,  800-96  SECTION 814 \u2014 PLACEMENT OF CONCRETE BRIDGE DECKS     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  ensure  that  longitudinal  grooves  are  parallel  to  the  centerline  of  construction  or working line.  Ensure that the spacing of longitudinal grooves is 1\u00bd in.  Spacing does not need to be variable.  Immediately  after  saw  cut  grooving,  leave  the  pavement  in  a  washed  and  clean condition, free of all residue and slurry.  Do not permit residue to flow across lanes used by the traveling public or into gutters or drainage facilities.  814.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  This work will not be measured separately for payment.  814.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.  No separate payment will be made for this work.  Payment will be included with the payment, and at the Contract unit price per cubic yard for Concrete Superstructure Class HP Bridge Deck.

This work includes the removal of dirt, organic growth such as moss or lichens, efflorescence, and all other accumulated foreign matter from concrete surfaces through the application of a high- pressure water spray to the affected surfaces.  The intent of this work is to produce a sufficiently clean  surface  for  color  matching  of  replacement  and  repair  work,  the  application  of  concrete sealers, or other required structural repair or rehabilitation work.  Bridge Structures.  This  work  includes  the  removal  of  all  dirt,  organic  growth,  efflorescence  and  all  other  foreign particles, including sand, salt, guano, and other debris from steel or concrete bridge girders, cross frames, trusses, pier tops, utility supports, utility pipes and conduits, bearing devices, beam seats, scuppers, and other bridge components through the application of a high-pressure water spray to the affected surfaces.  Do  not  remove  or  attempt  to  remove  paint,  sealant,  or  any  other  weatherproof  material  or waterproof coating.  Existing  paint  systems  on  Department  bridges  may  contain  toxic  substances  such  as  lead, chromium,  or  cadmium,  and  these  substances  are  considered  hazardous  to  personnel,  the environment,  and  the  public  proximate  to  the  Project.    Plan  and  take  appropriate  precautions during the cleaning operation for waste (including water runoff), containments, and disposal to meet  the  State  and  Federal  requirements  for  the  protection  of  workers,  the  public,  and  the environment.  815.02  EQUIPMENT.  General.  Ensure that the high-pressure water cleaning equipment has sufficient controls to vary the water pressure so that it can be adjusted to clean the concrete surfaces without damaging the surface being cleaned.  Ensure that the equipment produces a maximum pressure of up to 3000 psi and has a functional pressure gauge and control incremented so that the pressure can be adjusted and  maintained  consistently.    Ensure  the  availability  of  a  sufficient  variety  of  nozzle  tips  and accessories so that the spray can be applied uniformly to all applicable parts of the structure.  Do not allow the tip to concentrate the spray at less than 25 degrees to the surface.  Provide potable water to be used for cleaning.  Do not use detergents to wash the bridge or concrete structure.  Bridge Structures.  Ensure  that  the  cleaning  equipment  includes  the  necessary  high-pressure  water  cleaning equipment and all ancillary equipment necessary to flush, clean, and remove all foreign material  800-98  SECTION 815 \u2014 HIGH-PRESSURE WATER CLEANING        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  from the bridge structure, including hand tools, compressors, water tanks, water pumps, personal protective  equipment,  and  storage  containers  for  proper  disposal.    Determine  the  method  and equipment, subject to the Engineer\u2019s approval, that is best suited to successfully complete the cleaning operation.  815.03  CONSTRUCTION.  Protection of Wildlife.  All nests of protected migratory birds on bridges are presumed to be active and occupied between April 15 and December 15.  Do not clean or wash the areas within 3 ft laterally of the nest; begin washing at the 3-ft line and progress away from the nest.  Before April 15 and after December 15, nests of protected migratory birds on bridges will most likely be inactive and unoccupied.  Through coordination with the Engineer, confirm that the nests are   unoccupied.  If unoccupied, remove the nests as part of the cleaning operation based on a USFW Migratory Bird Permit Program.  Do not clean or wash the areas within 3 ft laterally of a bat nest; begin washing at the 3-ft line and progress away from the nest.  Remove the nests of unprotected species as part of the cleaning operations.  Treat pigeons as humanely as possible.  Concrete Surfaces.  In the presence of the engineer, perform a test cleaning in an inconspicuous area of the structure to  establish  the  appropriate  pressure  to  produce  a  sufficiently  clean  and  undamaged  surface. Start  the  initial  pressure  for  the  test  area  at  approximately  500  psi,  and  gradually  increase  as necessary  until  the  surface  has  been  adequately  cleaned  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  engineer. When the test area has been sufficiently cleaned, the Engineer will record the pressure, nozzle used, angle of impingement of the water stream, approximate cleaning rate per square foot, and other pertinent information for reference and inspection during the cleaning operations.  Provide a supply of clean potable water for the operation.  Do not combine any additives, such as de- greasers, chemical cleaners, detergents, or abrasives, with the water used for cleaning.  Perform the Cleaning of concrete surfaces by moving the wand in a smooth stroke to achieve a uniform and thorough cleaning over the entire surface without pitting or marring.  Collect  and  dispose  of  the  solid  material  removed  from  the  bridge  structure  by  the  cleaning operation  at  approved  waste  sites.

This work includes placing a Portland cement concrete overlay on a prepared surface of bridge decks, precast concrete butted box beams, deck slabs, deck planks, or other specified concrete substrate at the required locations.  816.02  MATERIALS.  Use  Portland  cement  concrete  that  is  Class  HP  and  conforms  to  SECTION  601,  except  as modified herein.  816.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Existing Bridge Decks.  a.  Surface Scarification.  Scarify existing bridge decks in an approved manner.  b.  Surface Preparation.  Perform the blast-cleaning of an area of the deck before the 24-hour water  soak  period  preceding  placement  of the  overlay  on the  area.    Perform  the  blast- cleaning by a method approved by the Engineer in writing.  Clean all debris, including dirty water,  resulting from the  blast-cleaning  operations  from the  blast-cleaned  surfaces  and from other areas where debris may have accumulated.  Remove all dust and other debris. Protect the blast-cleaned areas, as necessary, against contamination before the 24-hour presoaking.  Blast-clean contaminated areas and areas exposed more than 36 hours after cleaning  again,  as  directed  by  the  Engineer  and  at  no  additional  expense  to  the Department.  Soak  the  prepared  surface  with  clean  water  for  not  less  than  24  hours  before  the placement of the Class HP concrete overlay.  Maintain the surface in a clean, saturated condition  by  using  polyethylene  film  or  other  suitable  water-impermeable  clear  covers, until ready to receive the overlay.  Before the overlay is applied, blow off all standing water with oil-free compressed air.  Precast Concrete Butted Box Beams, Deck Slabs, or Deck Beams.  Finish the surfaces of Precast Concrete Butted Box Beams, Deck Slabs, or Deck Planks upon which  an  overlay  will  be  applied  with  a  roughened  surface  with  amplitude  of  \u00bc  in.  minimum. Ensure that the method of roughening does not cause cracking.  After  the  placement  and  curing  of  the  shear  key  grout  and  successful  post-tensioning  of  the structural elements is complete, and before placing the overlay, blast-clean the entire area of the deck  according  to  Subsection  816.03.1(b).    Ensure  that  the  profile  is  maintained  after  blast cleaning.  Protect galvanized reinforcing steel and any other appurtenances cast into the surface of the precast elements from the effect of the blast medium so that damage to the galvanization does not occur.  800-102  SECTION 816 \u2014 CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK OVERLAYS         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Bonding Grout.  Apply bonding grout as follows.  After the surface has been cleaned and wetted, and immediately before placing concrete, thoroughly broom, brush, or spray a thin (approximately \u215b-in.) coating of bonding grout onto the saturated bridge deck.  Use bonding grout that consists of equal parts, by volume, of Portland cement, microsilica (solids part) and mortar sand with sufficient water to form a slurry.  Do not exceed water-to-cementitious ratio by weight of 0.40.  Ensure that the consistency of the slurry facilitates the application in a thin, even coating that will not run or puddle.  Do not retemper bonding grout.  Broom  bonding  grout  with  straight  push  brooms  at  all  joints  and  concrete  surfaces  around  or below reinforcing steel.  Ensure that all prepared surface areas receive a thorough, even coating, and that no excess bonding grout is permitted to collect in pockets.  Coat all surfaces to be in contact with new concrete with the bonding grout.  Limit  the  rate  of  bonding  grout  application  to  that  surface  area  that  can  be  covered  with  new concrete before the bonding grout begins to dry out.  Ensure that the application of the bonding grout is not more than 5 ft from the leading edge of the overlay.  If drying does occur, as evidenced by a light gray color, remove the bonding grout by sandblasting.  Do not wet or spray the wet or dry bonding grout.  Limitations of Mixing.  a.  Temperature and Weather Conditions.  Ensure that all weather and concrete temperature  requirements meet Subsection 814.03.3 except as modified below.  b.  Cold  Weather  Concrete.    Do  not  place  Class  HP  concrete  mixtures  when  ambient temperatures are below 45\u00b0F.  However, the Class HP concrete may be placed at 45\u00b0F when rising temperatures are forecast and if the forecast indicates temperatures over 45\u00b0F for a minimum period of eight hours after the placement has been completed.  If the minimum air temperatures will not be met, the Contractor may place concrete if the structure is enclosed and external heat is provided to meet specified ambient temperature requirement for placement.  At temperatures above 85\u00b0F, the Engineer may require placements to be made at night or in the early morning hours if a satisfactory surface finish is not being achieved.  If any deviation  from  the  approved  Traffic  Management  Plan  is  necessary,  a  resubmittal  is required.  c.  Inclement  Weather.

Ensure  that  the maximum  water cement ratio does not exceed 0.40 by weight.  Coloring Pigment.  Use coloring pigments for integrally colored concrete or patching mortar that meets ASTM C979 and  is  approved  by  the  Engineer.    Use  coloring  pigments  according  to  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  Portland Cement Bonding Grout Slurry.  Use bonding grout slurry that has the cement and mortar sand proportioned 1:1 by volume.  Add water in sufficient quantity to form a slurry.  Concrete Anchors.  Use mechanical concrete anchors that are the hooked type expansion bolts galvanized according  to Subsection M05.05.4(c) and has been approved by the Engineer.  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-107    Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Prototype (Samples).  Submit  to  the  Engineer  a  prototype  (1  ft  \u00d7  1  ft  \u00d7  3  in.  min.)  showing  color  and  texture  of  the concrete  and/or  mortar  required  specifically  for  Repairs  to  Structural  Concrete  Masonry  with Integrally Colored Concrete or Patching Mortar.  Provide, in writing, the mix design and methods for obtaining any required surface finish (e.g., exposed aggregate) for each material.  Submit the prototype(s) sufficiently in advance to allow for review and approval of the repair material.  The Engineer  must  approve  the  prototypes  in  writing  and,  if  necessary,  gain  approval  from  the Department\u2019s Historic Preservation Specialist before use in production.  817.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Surface Preparation (All Repair Methods).  Remove  all  deteriorated,  soft  or  honeycombed  concrete  from  the  areas  to  be  repaired,  using suitable power and hand tools, to a uniform depth, sufficient to expose a bonding surface of sound material.  Do not use power tools that cause or may cause over-breakage of concrete.  Ensure that  pneumatic/chipping  hammers  are  not  heavier  than  the  nominal  30-lb  class.    To  remove concrete  within  2  in.  beneath  or  around  reinforcing  steel  designated  to  remain,  use pneumatic/chipping hammers or mechanical chipping tools that are not heavier than the nominal 15-lb  class.    Do  not  allow  tools  to  contact  reinforcing  steel  to  remain.    At  the  direction  of  the Engineer, saw cut the perimeter of the area to be repaired parallel to the horizontal and/or vertical axis of the element being repaired to a depth of at least \u00be-in.  Do not allow any thin or feathered edges.  Ensure that areas to be repaired are roughly circular or rectangular in outline.  Avoid re- entrant corners and shapes that include acute angles.  Saw cut the boundaries of areas to be removed square to a minimum depth of 1 in.  Do not allow thin, tapered, or feathered edges.  Where reinforcing steel is surrounded by deteriorated concrete or where at least one-half of the rebar surface area is exposed, ensure that the depth of concrete removal includes all deteriorated concrete but not less than that depth necessary to allow for a 1 in. minimum annular clearance around the reinforcing bars.  Extend concrete removal along the reinforcement to where it is well bonded  to  sound  concrete.    Clean  all  corroded  reinforcing  bars  to  remain  within  the  concrete removal boundaries by sandblasting or by other suitable methods approved by the Engineer to remove all rust.  For bars that have lost \u00bc or more of their original diameter, supplement these with new bars spliced in place.  Lap new bars (30 diameters on both sides of the affected area) to develop the required full strength of the bar.  Additional concrete removal may be necessary to provide this lap.  Dual bars of equivalent or greater cross-sectional area may be used.  Maintain required concrete cover.  Ensure  that  all  newly  exposed  concrete  repair  surfaces  are  free  of  loose  particles  and  other foreign  material.    Clean  the  repair  areas  and  roughen  the  areas  by  the  use  of  sandblasting, compressed air, air and water blasting, steam, wire brushing, or other methods approved by the Engineer in writing.  The Contractor may use one or any combination of the various options for cleaning the repair areas as directed by the Engineer.  Once  all  deteriorated  concrete  has  been  removed,  maintain  the  existing  sound  concrete  in  a clean, rough, and surface saturated moist condition until the concrete repair has been completed.  800-108  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  When  an  epoxy-resin  agent  is  specified,  ensure  that  the  prepared  sound  concrete  surface  is thoroughly dried before applying the epoxy-resin.  During the removal of the designated portions of the structure, avoid damaging the portions that will remain in place.  If the removal operation causes excessive damage to portions of the concrete that  will  remain,  cease  operations  and  submit  a  proposed  alternative  removal  method  for approval.  Ensure that no debris or any other material falls onto the roadway or waterway below the bridge. Should  debris  or  material  fall  onto the roadway or  waterway, remove the  material  immediately and cease all work until a revised procedure of operation has been submitted and approved by the Engineer in writing.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages or injuries as a result of debris or material falling.  Do not store or bury material or debris on site.  Keep  the  surface  against  which  mortar  will  be  placed  wet  for  at  least  one  hour  and  allow  the surface  to  dry  to  a  saturated  surface  dry  (SSD)  condition  just  before  application  of  the  repair material.  Where bonding agents are specified for use, apply the agents according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  If practical, ensure that the contact time is not exceeded.  If the Contact time is  exceeded,  reapply  the  bonding  agent.    Reapplication,  including  form  removal  and  re- installation, will be at no additional cost to the Department.  Use  forms  for  Portland  cement  concrete  repairs  when  necessary  to  confine  the  concrete  and shape  it  to  the  required  lines.    The  forms  may  partially  require  progressive  installation  as  the concrete  is  placed  as  a  result  of  confinements  for  placing  concrete  due  to  the  location  of  the particular  repair  or  restoration  required.    Ensure  that  the  forms  have  sufficient  strength  to withstand the pressure resulting from placing operations, is maintained rigidly in position, and is sufficiently  tight  to  prevent  loss  of  mortar  from  the  concrete.    Do  not  use  form  oils.    Use  an alternative  method  or  material  for  facilitating  form  release  that  will  not  cause  discoloration  or staining of the concrete.  All methods or materials are subject to the approval of the Engineer.  With respect to temperature and weather conditions, use concrete repair materials according to Subsections 601.03.4, 601.03.5, and 601.03.6.  Placement of Reinforcing.  Repairs less than 1\u00bd-in. depth do not require wire mesh reinforcement unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.  Where the thickness of the repair mortar exceeds 1\u00bd-in. depth and existing bar reinforcement is available, attach galvanized wire mesh reinforcement to the bars with tie wire.  If existing rebar is not available, install wire mesh reinforcement using mechanical concrete anchors according to the requirements of the Table below.  Where the repair exceeds a 4-in. depth, use a single layer of wire mesh to reinforce each 1-in. thickness of patch material.  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-109        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Size and Spacing of Anchors  Thickness of Placement (in.) 1\u00bd to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 over 6  Overhead Surfaces Diameter (in.) Spacing (in.) \u00bc at 24 \u00bc at 20 \u215c at 17 \u215c at 16  Vertical Surfaces Diameter (in.) Spacing (in.) \u00bc at 24 \u00bc at 24 \u215c at 21 \u215c at 20  Top Horizontal Surface Dia. (in.) Spacing (in.) \u00bc at 36 \u00bc at 36 \u215c at 36 \u215c at 36  Use mechanical concrete anchors that are galvanized and hooked-type expansion bolts in drilled holes.  Use bolts with sufficient engagement in sound masonry to resist a pull out force of 150 lb. Ensure that the exposed end of each anchor has at a minimum a right-angle bend for engaging reinforcement.  Use at least three anchors in each individual patch area.  Application of Pneumatically Applied Mortar (Shotcrete).  a.  Submittals.    Provide  Shop  Drawings,  details,  material  Certificates  of  Compliance (including mill test reports), mix designs, Quality Control (QC) Plan to include construction procedures,  detailed  construction  sequencing  plans,  and  details  of  temporary  debris shields.  Submit submittals for review and approval by the Engineer a minimum of 45 days before the commencement of work.  Ensure that the QC Plan includes the following:  \u25cf  Number and qualifications of personnel involved in shotcrete placement  \u25cf  Surface preparation method  \u25cf  Equipment and materials for placement, finishing, and curing  \u25cf  Placement  method  including  application  rates,  plans  for  multiple  layers  where  applicable, and methods for achieving required thickness and finish  \u25cf  Curing method  \u25cf  QC testing and inspection personnel  \u25cf  QC  testing  and  inspection  methods  and  frequencies  including  determinations  of thickness and strength of placed shotcrete and checking for hollow areas and surface defects  \u25cf  Methods for correcting deficiencies in shotcrete thickness, strength, hollow areas, and  surface defects  \u25cf  Documentation of nozzle operator\u2019s experience  Before new personnel can start work, ensure that shotcreting nozzle operators have at least one year of experience in the application of shotcrete and have completed at least  800-110  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  three projects of comparable nature or work under the immediate supervision of a foreman or instructor with at least two years of such experience.  Do not begin work until the QC Plan has been approved by the Engineer.  b.  Batching and Mixing.  Aggregate and cement may be batched by weight or by volume. Ensure that the mixing equipment can thoroughly mix the materials in sufficient quantity to  maintain  placing  continuity.    Ensure  that  ready  mix  shotcrete  complies  with SECTION 601.  c.  Application Equipment.  Apply the shotcrete by pneumatic equipment that sprays the mix onto  the  prepared  surface  at  the  velocity  needed  to  produce  a  compacted,  dense, homogeneous  mass.    Ensure  that  the  velocity  of  the  material  as  it  leaves  the  nozzle maintains a uniform rate determined for the given job conditions to minimize rebound.  \u25cf  Dry Mix Process.  Ensure that the delivery equipment delivers a continuous, smooth, uniformly mixed material to the nozzle.  Equip the nozzle with a water ring and valve to  permit  adjustment  of  the  water.    Ensure  that  the  nozzle  can  deliver  a  conical discharge stream.  \u25cf  Wet Mix Process.  Only use pneumatic-feed type delivery equipment.  d.  Preconstruction Testing.  Make test panels for each application crew using the equipment, materials,  mixture  proportions,  and  procedures  proposed  for  the  job  before  the commencement of the work.  Make a test panel at least 30 in. \u00d7 30 in. for each mixture being considered and for each shooting position to be encountered in the job.  Fabricate the test panels to the same thickness as in the structure but not less than 4 in.  Take at least five, 3-in. minimum diameter cores from each panel for testing according to ASTM C1604.  Obtain samples for testing in the presence of the Engineer, which will be tested by the Engineer.  e.  Placement  of  Shotcrete.    Apply  shotcrete  with  the  same  equipment  and  the  same technique as used to construct the approved test panels.  Ensure that the nozzle operator constructing the test panels is the same operator used in placing shotcrete in the work. Apply  the  shotcrete  as  dry  as  practical  to  prevent  shrinkage  cracking,  sagging,  and sloughing off.  Use shooting guide strips or wires to ensure square corners, straight lines, and a plane surface of mortar.  Place the strips or wires to minimize trapping of rebound.  Do not re- use rebounded materials.  Install thickness measuring pins on 5-ft centers in all direction. Ensure  that  the  pins  are  non-corrosive.    The  Engineer  may  approve  other  methods  to establish if the required minimum thickness of shotcrete is being applied if the Contractor can satisfactorily demonstrate the reliability of the other methods.  Apply a sufficient number of mortar coats to obtain the required thickness.  On vertical and overhead surfaces, ensure that the thickness of each coat is not greater than 1 in., and is placed so that it will neither sag nor decrease the bond of the preceding coat.  Ensure that the  time  interval  between  successive  layers  in  sloping,  vertical  or  overhanging  work,  is sufficient to allow initial set but not final set to develop.  At the time initial set is developing, clean the surface to remove the thin film of laitance to provide a bond with succeeding  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-111     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  applications.   Remove  and  dispose  of  all  rebound  or  accumulated  loose sand  from the surface  by  brooming  or  scraping.    Cover  the  surface  before  placing  the  original  or succeeding  layers  of  mortar  and  ensure  that  the  mortar  is  not  embedded  in  the  work. Remove all laitance that has been allowed to take final set by sandblasting and thoroughly clean the surfaces without damaging the concrete.  Ensure an SSD condition exists before shooting new material.  Position and secure the wire fabric reinforcement to minimize vibration while the shotcrete is being applied.  Lap mesh one and a half squares in both directions.  Bend tie wires flat in  the  plane  of the  mesh  and  ensure there  are no  large  knots.    Place  reinforcement to ensure that proper cover is maintained.  Apply the shotcrete to prevent accumulation of rebound on the surface still to be covered.  Fill first the horizontal and vertical corners and any area where rebound cannot escape or be  blown  free.    Hold  the  nozzle  at  a  distance  and  angle  to  place  material  behind  the reinforcement before material is allowed to accumulate on its face.  Do not place shotcrete through more than one layer of reinforcing steel in one application.  Unless suitable means to screen the nozzle is provided, discontinue shotcreting if wind or air currents will cause separation of the stream during placement.  Conduct  hammer  sounding  in  the  presence  of  the  Engineer  after  sufficient  strength  is obtained  to  prevent  damage.    Hollow  areas  and  areas  containing  any  other  non- conforming  work  or  defects  are  considered  deficient  areas.    Use  an  approved  repair method, including proposed mitigation measures, to correct deficient areas.  Submit the repair method for review and approval by the Engineer in writing before commencement of  any repair  work.    At  the  discretion  of  the  Engineer, repair  deficient  areas  after  initial placement  of the  shotcrete  is  completed.    Remove  and  replace  with  fresh  shotcrete  all shotcrete defects, including lack of uniformity, segregation, honeycombing, lamination, or the presence of any dry patches, slugs, voids, or sand pockets, all at no additional cost to the Department.  f.  Acceptance Testing.  Prepare a minimum of one test panel for each day of production up to 50 cu yd and one test panel for each additional increment up to 50 cu yd of shotcrete placed.  Ensure that test panels have minimum dimensions of 24\u2033 \u00d7 24\u2033 \u00d7 4\u2033 gunned in the same position as the work represented.  Ensure that the panels are gunned during the course of the work by the previously qualified nozzle operator.  Cure the panels and obtain a minimum of three cores as described under Preconstruction Testing in Para. d above. Cores will be tested by the Engineer according to the requirements under Preconstruction Testing.  g.  Limitation of Mixing.  Place shotcrete according to the temperature and weather conditions  in SECTION 601.  h.  Finish.  Finish all exposed surfaces straight and true, approximating the original contour  as close as practical as indicated on the Plans.  i.  Curing.  Ensure that shotcrete is cured according to SECTION 601.  800-112  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Do not use curing compounds on any surfaces against which additional shotcrete or other cementitious finishing materials will be bonded.  Application of Form and Cast-in-Place Concrete.  a.  General.  Perform repairs accomplished by the form and cast-in-place method according  to SECTION 808.  b.  Use of Self Consolidating Concrete (SCC) in Form and Cast-in-Place Concrete.  Refer to  SECTION 601.  c.  Final  Finish.    Finish  all  exposed  surfaces  straight  and  true,  approximating  the  original  contour as close as practical as indicated on the Plans.  Application of Integrally Colored Concrete or Patching Mortar.  Mix, apply, and cure concrete patching mortar according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  a.  Prime Coat.  Before placing the concrete or mortar on a previously prepared and approved concrete  surface,  apply a  prime  coat to the  entire  area  to  be  patched  using  a  Portland cement bonding grout slurry.  Ensure that the consistency of the Portland cement bonding grout slurry can be applied with a brush on a prepared moist concrete surface in a thin (approximately \u215b-in.) even coating that will not run or puddle.  Do not allow any excess bonding grout to collect in pockets.  Apply Portland cement bonding grout to the concrete and the surfaces of the reinforcing  bars  and  into  the  spaces  between  the  reinforcing  bars  and  the  prepared concrete surfaces.  Ensure that all surfaces receive a thorough, even coating.  Limit the rate of bonding grout application to that surface area that can be covered with new concrete or mortar before the bonding grout begins to dry out.  Do not incorporate into  the  work  any  grout  that  has  dried  or  become  unworkable,  as  determined  by  the Engineer.  If drying does occur, remove the bonding grout and place new bonding grout. The Engineer must approve the removal of the bonding grout method.  b.  Placing and Consolidation.  Place, consolidate, and finish the integrally colored Portland cement concrete on a previously prepared surface for which a Portland cement bonding grout slurry has been applied.  Place integrally colored patching mortar in \u00bd-in. to 1-in. lift layers within 5 to 10 minutes after water is added to avoid the rapid setup of the material after the application of the bonding grout slurry.  If more than  one  lift  layer  is  required to  perform  the  repair,  do  not  allow  the  previously placed lift layer to dry, and roughen its surface before placing the next layer.  Do  not  apply  patching  mortar  when  the  ambient  temperature  is  below  45\u00b0F  or  is  not according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  SECTION 817 \u2014 REPAIRS TO STRUCTURE CONCRETE MASONRY  800-113       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  c.  Finish.    Use  an  experienced  mason  to  finish  all  exposed  surfaces  straight  and  true, approximating  the  original  contour  as  close  as  practical.    Ensure  that  the  final  finished surfaces  match  the  texture,  color,  and  aggregate  exposure  of  the  existing  concrete surfaces adjoining or proximate to the area where new concrete has been placed.  Capture all waste and water from the finishing operations, and dispose these materials.  d.  Curing.  Use curing procedures and methods that comply with the color additive from the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and as set forth in Subsection 601.03.7.  Do not use curing compounds unless specifically required by the manufacturer of the color additive.  817.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.

This work includes removing deteriorated concrete from bridge deck surfaces, erecting formwork, and placing new Portland cement concrete.  a.  Partial Depth Removal.  The limits of partial depth concrete removal are those areas for which deteriorated concrete extends less than 50 percent of the depth of the original deck.  b.  Full Depth Removal.  The limits of full depth concrete removal are those areas for which deteriorated concrete extends more than 50 percent of the depth of the original deck.  818.02  MATERIALS.  Use materials that conform to the following requirements.  Concrete.  Use concrete that conforms to the requirements for Class HP material as stated in Subsections",
            "601.02.1": " 601.02.1  and  601.03.1,  with  the  exception  to  use  coarse  aggregate  gradation  that  meets Subsection M02.03 for aggregate size \u00bd in. or \u215c in.  The size used is at the discretion of the Contractor.  Bonding Agent.  Use bonding agent that is an all-purpose, high-strength, moisture-insensitive, rigid bonding agent that  is  listed  on  the  Department\u2019s  Approved  Materials  List.    Ensure  that  the  material  used  is compatible with the surfaces to be bonded.  Reinforcement.  Use  reinforcement  that  conforms  to  ASTM  615  Grade  60  Reinforcing  Steel  as  presented  in SECTION 810.  818.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Removal of Deteriorated Concrete.  Remove all loose, deteriorated, or unsound concrete.  Make a saw cut to an approximate depth of \u00be in. along all boundaries of the repair patches before removal, except those patches bounded by the bridge curbing.  Do not cut into the top mat of bridge deck reinforcing steel.  Perform concrete removal so as to not damage reinforcing steel or saw cut areas at the repair boundaries.  Remove  the  concrete  to  a  minimum  depth  of  1  in.    Do  not  use  jackhammers  heavier  than  a nominal  30  lb.    Do  not  use  chipping  hammers  heavier  than  a  nominal  15-lb  class  to  remove concrete from areas beneath reinforcing bars.  Provide hand tools such as hammers and chisels  SECTION 818 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK REPAIR  800-115          Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  for removal of particles of unsound concrete or to achieve the required depth throughout the repair areas, including the saw cut edges.  Do not place pneumatic tools in direct contact with reinforcing steel  or  the  surrounding  concrete  to  remain.    The  Engineer  can  require  other  methods  if  the Engineer determines that the Contractor\u2019s method is damaging the concrete.  Where reinforcing steel is surrounded by deteriorated concrete or where at least one-half of its surface  area  is  exposed,  ensure  that  the  depth  of  concrete  removal  includes  all  deteriorated concrete but not less than that depth necessary to allow for \u00be-in. clearance below the primary reinforcing bars in the top mat of reinforcing steel.  If removal extends deeper than 50 percent of the original deck thickness solely for obtaining the \u00be-in. clearance, the repair is still considered a partial-depth  repair.    It  is  not  necessary  to  remove  concrete  underneath  any  temperature  and distribution  reinforcement  that  has  no  more  than  one  half  of  its  surface  area  exposed.    For reinforcing bars that have lost 25 percent or more of their original diameter, supplement the bars with  new  bars  spliced  in  place  while  maintain  the  required  cover,  especially  for  dual  bars.    In splicing new bars, lap sufficiently (30 diameters on both sides of the affected areas) to develop the full strength of the bar and, if necessary, provide additional concrete removal for the lap.  Dual bars of equivalent or greater section may be used.  Perform deck removal by hydrodemolition according to SECTION 840.  Use alternative methods only with written approval from the Engineer.  Preparation of Sound Concrete and Reinforcing.  Clean  all  exposed  reinforcing  bars  and  newly  exposed  concrete  by  sandblasting  or  other mechanical abrasion methods.  Ensure  that  the  exposed  concrete  and  reinforcing  steel  surfaces  are  free  of  rust,  oil,  solvent, grease, dirt, dust, bitumen, loose particles, and other foreign matter before the application of the bonding  agent.    Use  a  large  sized vacuum  cleaner  and/or  an  air jet to  remove  dust  and  other particles before placing the bonding agent.  Repair all damage to steel reinforcement coatings.  Forms for Full Depth Removal.  Ensure that forms used for patching can support the quantity of fresh concrete needed to install the patch.  Bonding Agent.  Apply bonding agent to the substrate to a thickness of according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.  Follow  the  manufacturer\u2019s  recommendations  for  curing  the  bonding  agent  before  placing  the concrete.  Placing and Finishing Concrete.  Hand  manipulate  the  new  concrete  and  strike-off  the  concrete  slightly  above  the  final  grade. Then, mechanically consolidate and screed to a final grade.  800-116  SECTION 818 \u2014 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK REPAIR         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Provide a mechanical or hand trowel finish to produce a tight and uniform surface.  As  soon  as the  finishing  has  been  completed, seal  all  vertical joints  with  adjacent  concrete  by painting with thinned grout.  Apply  white  pigmented  liquid  curing  compound  immediately  after  the  joint  application  is completed.  Use a rate of application 15 sq yd/gal, applied evenly and uniformly over the surface area.  If the curing compound is not applied within 10 minutes after the final screeding, cover the finished concrete surfaces with wet burlap until the application of curing compound can be made. Remove the repaired concrete in the rejected areas, and re-repair the areas.  Do not allow traffic or external loads from heavy equipment such as pavers on the repaired deck surfaces until the concrete has reached a minimum of 95 percent of its 28-day compressive design strength.  818.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Portland Cement Concrete Deck Repairs (Partial Depth Removal) and Portland Cement Concrete Deck Repairs (Full Depth Removal) will be measured by the number of square feet of the repairs made.  818.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.

This liability shall continue until the warranty work is accepted by the Engineer.  The liability is in addition to the Contractor performing and/or paying for any required warranty work, and shall include liability for injuries and/or damages and any expenses resulting that are not  attributable  to  normal  wear  and  tear  of  traffic  and  weather,  but  are  due  to  non- compliant materials, faulty workmanship, and/or Contractor operations.  Quality Control.  The Contractor shall provide an affidavit from the joint manufacturer certifying that the aggregate meets  all  requirements and  a  certificate  of  compliance  from the  binder manufacturer  certifying that the binder conforms to these Specifications.  At the direction of the Engineer, the Contractor shall arrange for and have present, at the time the first joint-sealing operation will be performed, a manufacturer\u2019s representative knowledgeable in the  methods  of  installation  of  the  joint  system.    The  Contractor  shall  also  arrange  to  have  the representative present at such other times as the Engineer may request.  Evaluation Method.  The Department will conduct evaluations of each asphaltic expansion joint system installed under this Contract.  Warranty Requirements.  Warranty work will be required when the threshold limit for a condition parameter is exceeded as a result of a defect in material and/or workmanship.  Specific threshold limits and segment limits and other items that the Contractor is responsible for are covered in the previous sections of this Specification.  To determine whether the failure to meet the warranty criteria is a result of defects in materials and/or  workmanship,  a  joint  field  investigation  by  the  Department  and  the  Contractor  will  be conducted.  The Department and Contractor may elect to have a forensic investigation conducted. The  decision  to  undertake  a  forensic  investigation,  the  scope  of  the  investigation,  and  the selection of the party to conduct the investigation will be agreed to by the Department and the Contractor.  All costs related to the forensic investigation will be shared proportionately between the Contractor and the Department based on the determined cause of the condition.  During  the  warranty  period,  the  Contractor  will  not  be  held  responsible  for  distresses  that  are caused by factors unrelated to materials and workmanship.  These include, but are not limited to, chemical and fuel spills, vehicle fires, snow plowing, and quality assurance testing such as coring. Other factors considered to be beyond the control of the Contractor that may contribute to distress will be considered by the Engineer on a case-by-case basis upon receipt of a written request from the Contractor.  800-132  SECTION 823 \u2014 BRIDGE JOINTS        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Emergency Repairs.

The  Engineer  will  review  the  submittals  according  to Subsection 105.02.  Inspection and Testing.  a. Mill Orders.  Furnish four  copies  of  mill  orders.  Do not roll the material or perform work before the Engineer has been notified where the orders have been  placed so that he/she may arrange for the inspection.  The manufacturer shall furnish all facilities for inspecting and testing the weight and quality of all  material  at  the  mill where it  is  manufactured.  Furnish suitable  testing  equipment, properly  calibrated.    Prepare  the  pieces  for  the  testing  machine  at  no  cost  to  the Department.  The manufacturer shall perform all testing of materials.  Furnish the Engineer with four copies of  the mill report of the chemical and physical tests before starting work.  Do not cut off any markings until the  inspector  has  established  the heat  and  designation  and  determined  the  method  of  continued  identity.    Perform inspection and testing that conforms to SECTION 106.  b. Shop.  Notify the  Engineer 48 hours  in advance  of  the  start of work in the shop so that  an inspector can be on hand to inspect the material and workmanship.  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-135  Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  The  fabricator  shall  furnish  all  facilities  for  inspecting  and  testing  the  weight  and quality  of  workmanship  at  the  shop  where  the  material  is  fabricated.  Provide suitable testing equipment, properly calibrated, for the Department Inspector.  Provide full and safe  access  at  all  times  and  to  all  parts  of  the  mills  or  shops  where the  material  is  being manufactured or fabricated.  c.  Site.    The  Engineer  may  waive  shop  inspections  and  instead  inspect  all  fabricated material  when  delivered  at  the  work  site.    However,  if  the  Engineer  rejects  defective material, its repair or replacement will be performed at no additional cost to the Department, including any additional shipping costs.  Furnish a minimum of four copies of shipping statements that include the weights of the individual members.  Furnish  a  Certificate  of  Identification  as  defined  in  Subsection  11.4.1  of  the  AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications.  d.  Delegation  of  Authority.    The  Department  may  delegate  inspection  and  testing  to  an independent, accredited  laboratory  or  testing  company.  This  agency  shall  have  all  the prerogatives  as  previously  mentioned  for  the  Engineer  except  that,  in  the  event  of  a disagreement  of  substance,  the  Contractor  may  appeal  the  decision  to  the  Engineer whose decision will be final.  Fabrication.  a.  Storage  of Materials.  Store structural  material,  either  plain  or  fabricated, at  the bridge shop above the ground and on platforms, skids, or  other  supports.  Keep the materials free from dirt, grease, and other foreign matter and protected from any corrosion that will degrade the performance of the element.  b.  Holes for High-Strength Bolts and Unfinished Bolts.  \u25cf  General.  Ensure that all holes for bolts are either punched or drilled.  Material forming parts  of  a  member  composed  of  not  more  than  five  thicknesses  of  metal  may  be punched 1/16 in. larger than the  nominal  diameter  of  the  bolts  when  the  thickness of  the  material  is  not  greater  than  \u00be in. for  structural steel, \u215d in. for high-strength steel, or \u00bd in. for quenched and tempered alloy steel.  When  there  are  more  than  five  thicknesses  or  when  any  of  the  main  material  is thicker than \u00be in. for structural steel, \u215d in. for high-strength steel, or \u00bd in. for quenched and  tempered  alloy  steel,  ensure that  all  holes  are  either  subdrilled  and reamed  or drilled full size with sufficient tolerance to ensure that the standard size bolt passes though all parts without interference.  When required, ensure that all holes are either subpunched or subdrilled (subdrilled if thickness limitation governs) 3/16 in. smaller and, after assembling, reamed 1/16 in. larger or drilled full size to 1/16 in. larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts.  800-136  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  When shown on the Plans, enlarged or slotted holes are allowed with high-strength bolts.  \u25cf  Punched Holes.  Ensure that the diameter of the die does not exceed the diameter of the  punch  by  more  than  1/16-in.  If any holes must  be  enlarged to admit  the  bolts, ream the holes.  Ensure that the holes are clean cut without torn or ragged edges.  \u25cf  Reamed  or  Drilled  Holes.    Ensure  that  reamed  or  drilled  holes  are  cylindrical, perpendicular to the  member, and comply with the requirements of Para. b, first bullet above for size.  Where practical, direct reamers by mechanical means.  Remove burrs on  the  outside  surfaces and finish the holes with a slight chamfer.  Perform reaming and  drilling  with  twist  drills,  twist  reamers,  or  rotobroach  cutters.    Assemble connecting  parts  requiring  reamed  or  drilled  holes  that  securely  hold  while  being reamed or drilled and that are match marked before disassembling.  \u25cf  Accuracy  of  Holes.  Holes  not  more  than  1/32 in. larger  in  diameter  than  the  true decimal  equivalent  of  the  nominal  diameter  that  may  result  from  a  drill  or  reamer of  the  nominal  diameter  are  considered  acceptable.   The  slightly  conical  hole  that naturally results from punching operations is considered acceptable.  This would have the 1/32-in. tolerance, with the minimum at the small end of the taper being at least a clearance fit.  Ensure that the width of slotted holes that are produced by flame cutting or a combination  of  drilling  or  punching  and  flame  cutting  are  not  more  than  1/32 in. greater  than  the  nominal width.  Grind smooth the flame cut surface.  c.  Accuracy of Hole Group.  \u25cf  Accuracy Before Reaming.  Ensure that all holes punched full size, subpunched, or subdrilled are  accurately punched so that,  after  assembling (before any reaming is done), a cylindrical pin \u215b in. smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole  may  be  entered  perpendicular  to  the  face  of  the  member,  without  drifting,  in at  least  75  percent  of  the  contiguous  holes  in  the  same  plane.  If  the  requirement is  not  fulfilled,  the  badly  punched  pieces  will  be  rejected.  If  any  hole  will  not  pass a  pin  3/16 in. smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched hole, this will be cause for rejection.  \u25cf  Accuracy After Reaming.  When holes are reamed or drilled, ensure that 85 percent of the holes in any  contiguous group, after reaming or drilling, show no offset greater than 1/32 in. between adjacent  thicknesses of metal.  Ensure that all  steel  templates  have  hardened  steel  bushings  in  holes  accurately dimensioned from the  centerlines  of  the  connection  as  inscribed  on  the  template. Use the  centerlines  to  accurately locate the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.  d.  Holes for Ribbed Bolts, Turned Bolts, or other Approved Bearing-Type Bolts.  Subpunch or subdrill all holes  for  ribbed  bolts,  turned  bolts,  or  other  approved  bearing-type  bolts 3/16-in. smaller than the nominal  diameter  of the  bolt and reamed  when assembled, or drilled to a steel  template  or,  after  assembling,  drilled  from  the  solid  at  the  option  of the  fabricator.  Ensure that  the  finished holes provide a driving fit as specified.  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-137     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  e.  Preparation of Field Connections.  Subpunch or subdrill holes in all field connections and field  splices  of  main  members  of  trusses,  arches,  continuous  beam  spans,  bents, towers  (each  face),  plate  girders,  and  rigid frames  and  subsequently  reamed  while assembled or drilled full size to  a  steel  template.  Holes  for  field  splices  of  rolled  beam stringers  continuous  over  floor  beams  or  cross  frames  may  be  drilled  full  size unassembled to a steel template.  All holes for floor beams or cross frames  may be drilled full  size unassembled to  a steel  template.  Subpunch and ream all holes for floor beam and  stringer  field  end  connections  while  assembled  or  drilled  full  size  to  a  steel template.  Perform reaming  or  drilling  full  size  of  field  connection  holes  through  a  steel template  after  the  template has been located in the correct position and angle and firmly bolted in place, using at least two holes previously drilled for the connection.  Ensure that templates  used  for  reaming  matching  members,  or  the  opposite  faces  of  a  single member, are duplicates within 1/32 in.  Accurately locate templates used for connections on  like  parts  or  members  so  that  the  parts  or  members are duplicates and require no match-marking.  For any connection, in lieu of subpunching and reaming or subdrilling and reaming, the fabricator  may, as an option, drill holes full size with all thicknesses or material assembled in the proper position with the hole locations matching the Plans/Shop Drawings.  Bolts and Bolted Connections Using Unfinished, Turned, and Ribbed Bolts.  a.  General.  Ensure that bolts  are  unfinished,  turned,  or  an  approved  form  of  ribbed  bolts as designed.  Ensure that bolts have hexagonal heads and  nuts  and  are  of  a  length  that they  will  extend  entirely thorough the nut but not more than \u00bc in. beyond after completing torquing of the connection.  Use beveled washers where bearing faces have a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.  Ensure that bolts have single, self-locking nuts or double nuts.  b.  Unfinished  Bolts.  Ensure that bolts  in  shear  have  not  more  than  one  thread  within  the grip.  Ensure that the  diameter of the unfinished bolt is not more than 1/16 in. smaller than the diameter of the hole.  c.  Turned Bolts.  Ream holes for turned bolts, and turn the bolts to a light  driving fit, with threads  entirely  outside  of  holes,  and  use  a  washer.  Use \u00bc-in. nut  locks on all turned bolts.  d.  Ribbed  Bolts.  Special  types  of  ribbed  bolts,  with  drive  fit,  may  be  used  if  approved  by the  Engineer.    If the bolt twists before drawing tight, remove the bolt, re-ream the hole, and  replace  with  an  oversized  bolt.    Size  the  reamed  hole  to  meet  industry  standard practices to hold the bolt in place at the required torque.  Re-ream the hole to the minimum proper  size  to  hold  the  next  largest  standard  size  bolt,  which  shall  be  used  as  a replacement.  800-138  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Connections Using High-Strength Bolts.  a.  General.  This Subsection addresses the assembly of structural joints using ASTM F3125 Grade  A325  and  A490  high  strength  carbon  steel  bolts  or  equivalent  fasteners, tightened to to  a  high Subsection 824.03.3.  The  bolts  are  used  in  holes  conforming  tension.  b.  Bolted  Parts.  Ensure that the  slope  of  surfaces  of  bolted  parts  in  contact  with  the  bolt head and nut do not  exceed  1:20  with  respect  to  a  plane  normal  to  the  bolt  axis.  Fit bolted  parts  solidly  together when assembled and do not separate the bolts by gaskets or any other interposed compressible material.  When  assembled,  ensure  that  all  joint  surfaces,  including  those  adjacent  to  the  bolt heads, nuts or washers, are free of scale, except tight mill scale, and are also free of dirt, loose scale, burrs, other foreign material and other defects that would prevent solid seating of the parts.  Ensure that contact surfaces within friction-type joints are free of oil, paint, lacquer, rust inhibitor  or  galvanizing.    After  connection,  ensure  that  primers  and  paint  provide  a moisture-tight joint.  c.  Installation.  Clean and lubricate the threads.  Tighten each fastener to provide, when all fasteners in the joint are tight, at least the minimum bolt tension shown on the Bolt Tension Table in Para. f below.  Tighten  threaded  bolts  with  properly  calibrated  wrenches  or  by  the  turn-of-the  nut method.    If  required  because  of  bolt  entering  and  wrench  operation  clearances, tightening  by  either  procedure may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating.  d.  Washers.  Provide all fasteners  with  a  hardened washer  under  the  element  (nut  or  bolt  head)  turned in tightening.  Where  an  outer  face  of  the  bolted  parts  has  a  slope  of  more  than  1:20  with  respect to  a  plane  normal to the bolt axis, use a smooth beveled washer to compensate for the lack of parallelism.  On  diaphragm  connections  using  oversized  holes,  use  a  washer  over  every  oversized hole regardless of the part turned in tightening.  e.  Calibrated  Wrench  Tightening.  Calibrated  wrench  tightening  may  be  used  only  when installation  procedures  are  calibrated  on  a  daily  basis  and  when  a  hardened  washer is  used  under  the  element  turned  in  tightening.  Standard  torques  determined  from tables  or  from  formulas  that  are  assumed to relate torque to tension are not acceptable.  When calibrated wrenches are used for installation, set the wrenches to provide a tension not less  than 5 percent in excess of the minimum tension specified in the Bolt Tension Table  in  Para. f below.  Calibrate  the  installation  procedures  by  verification  testing  at least  once  each working  day  for  each  bolt  diameter,  length,  and  grade  using  fastener assemblies  that  are  being  installed  in  the  work.    Perform  the  verification  testing  in  a device  capable  of  indicating the  actual  bolt  tension  by  tightening three  typical  bolts  of  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-139     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  each diameter, length,  and  grade  from the  bolts being installed  and  with  a  hardened washer  from  the  washers  being  used  in  the  work  under  the  element  turned  in tightening.    Recalibrate  wrenches  when  a  significant  difference  is  noted  in  the  surface condition  of the  bolts,  threads,  nuts,  or  washers.    Perform the verification  during  the actual  installation  in the assembled  steel  work so that the wrench adjustment selected by  the  calibration  does  not  produce  a  nut  or  bolt  head  rotation from snug tight greater than that permitted in the Nut Rotation Table in Para. f below.  If manual  torque wrenches are used, turn nuts in the tightening direction when torque is measured.  When  calibrated  wrenches  are  used  to  install  and  tension  bolts  in  a  connection, install the  bolts  with hardened washers under the element turned in tightening bolts in all holes of  the  connection  and  bring  to  a  snug  tight  condition.    Following  this  initial  tightening operation,  tighten  the  connection  using  the  calibrated  wrench.    Ensure  that  tightening progresses  systematically  from  the  most  rigid  part of the joint to its free edges.  Return the wrench to touch up previously tightened bolts that  may  have  been  relaxed  as  a result  of  the  subsequent  tightening  of  adjacent  bolts  until  all  bolts  are  tightened to the prescribed amount.  f.  Turn-of-Nut Tightening.  Perform the verification testing using a representative sample of not less than three bolt and nut assemblies of each diameter, length, and grade to be used in the work at the start of work in a device capable of indicating bolt tension.  Ensure that this verification test demonstrates  that the method for estimating the snug tight condition and  controlling  the  turns  from  snug  tight  to  be  used  by  the  bolting  crew  develops  a tension  not  less  than  5  percent  greater  than  the  tension  required  by  the Bolt Tension Table below.  Perform periodic retesting when ordered by the Engineer.

During the  tightening operation, do not allow any rotation  of the part not turned by the wrench.  Tighten by progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.  800-140  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Nut Rotation from the Snug Tight Condition a,b Geometry of Outer Faces of Bolted Parts  Bolt length measured from underside of head  to end of bolt  Both faces normal to bolt axis  One face normal to bolt  axis and other face  sloped not more than  1:20.

For bolts installed  by \u00bd  turn and  less,  the  tolerance  should  be  plus  or  minus  30  degrees; for  bolts installed by \u2154 turn and more, the tolerance  should be plus or minus 45 degrees.  Applicable only to connections in which all material within grip of the bolt is steel.  No  research  work  has  been  performed  by  the  Research  Council on  Riveted  and  Bolted Structural Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure when bolt lengths exceed 12 diameters. Therefore, the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions.  g.  Inspection.  The  Engineer  will  approve  the  procedure  for  calibration  of  wrenches  and  installation  of bolts and will further observe the field installation to determine that these procedures are followed.  Spot  checks  will  be  made  with  a  manual  torque  wrench  that  has  been  calibrated  as previously specified.  Welding.  a.  General.    Ensure that  all  welding,  welder  qualifications,  prequalification  of  weld  details, and inspection of welds conform to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.  Do not weld or tack brackets, clips, shipping devices, or other material not required by the Contract  to  any  member  unless  shown  on  the  Shop  Drawings  and  approved  by  the Engineer in writing.  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-141             Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  b.  Qualification of Welders.  Ensure that all work is according to the best modern practices using qualified welding operators.  Use the same type of equipment as required for the execution of the actual construction work in qualifying welders and welding operators.  If  the  Contractor  prequalifies  its  metal-arc  welding  operators  according  to  the  standard qualification  procedures  of  the  American  Welding  Society  and  certifies  to  the  Engineer that an operator working on the structure has been prequalified previously, the Engineer may  consider  such  operator  qualified.    This  certificate  shall  state  that  the  operator  has been performing satisfactory welding of the required type within the three-month period previous to the subject work.  Submit a certification for each operator and for each Project, stating the:  \u25cf  Name of the operator \u25cf  Name and title of the person who conducted the examination \u25cf  Type of specimens \u25cf  Positions of welds \u25cf  Results of the test \u25cf  Date of the examination \u25cf  Identifying steel stamp symbol assigned  The prequalification certification may also be accepted as proof that an operator of field welding is qualified, if the Contractor who submits the certificate is properly staffed and equipped to conduct such an examination or if the examining and testing is performed by a recognized agency that is staffed and equipped for this purpose.  The qualification of a welder shall not prohibit his/her subsequent removal from the job for poor workmanship in the execution of welds.  The welder shall place his identification stamp near the welds that he/she has made.  Perform shop welding in areas sheltered from wind and weather with an ambient minimum temperature of 50\u00b0F.  c.  Qualification of Welding Procedure.  Submit a complete welding procedure specification for  welding  all  primary  members  and  other  members  on  which  welds  are  subject  to calculated stress before proceeding with fabrication.  d.  Procedures  for  Manual  Shielded  Metal-Arc  Welding.    Position  the  work  for  flat  position  welding when practical.  Inspection of Welds.  a.  General.  All welding, both shop and field, will be subject to inspection by the Engineer according to the ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code, as amended herein.  A minimum routine inspection program is outlined in Table 1.  However, do not construe the inspection to be limited to the program described.  b.  Visual Inspection of Welds and Welding Operations.  Allow unlimited, safe access to the site of welding operations to allow the Engineer to observe the procedure and techniques used on all welds.  800-142  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  c.  Non-Destructive Testing.  Implement a routine program of non-destructive testing on all welds  (shop  and  field)  carrying  calculated  stress  as  indicated  in  the  Table  on  the  next page.  Non-destructive testing will be performed by the Department.  Radiograph and furnish one set of films of shop butt welds and furnish all equipment and an operator at no cost to the Department for making magnetic particle tests of shop fillet welds.  Furnish all labor and equipment required to move and position the various members for inspection.  Machining.  Ensure  that  the  steel  fabricator  machines  all  steel  according  to  the  ASIC  Quality  Certification Program, the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, and the Steel Structures Technology Center Structural Bolting Handbook.  Marking, Shipping, Delivering, and Handling.  Paint  or  mark  each  member  with  an  erection  mark  for  identification  that  is  suitably  durable  or permanent.  Furnish an erection diagram showing these marks.  Furnish as many copies of material orders, shipping statements, and erection diagrams as the Engineer may direct.  Record the weights of the individual members on the statements.  Ensure that  members  weighing  more  than  3  tons  have  the  weights  marked  thereon.    Load  structural members on trucks or cars with proper dunnage and support so that they can be transported and unloaded  at  their  destination  without  being  excessively  stressed,  deformed,  or  otherwise damaged.  Ship  bolts,  nuts,  and  washers  (where  required)  from  each  rotational-capacity  lot  in  the  same container.  If there is only one production lot number for each size of nut and washer, the nuts and  washers  may  be  shipped  in  separate  containers.    Ship  pins, small  parts  and  packages of bolts, washers, and nuts in boxes, crates, kegs, or barrels, but ensure that the gross weight of any  package  does  not  exceed  300  lb.    Clearly  mark  a  list  and  description  of  the  contained materials on the outside of each shipping container.  Conduct the loading and delivery of the structural material so that the metal and its coating will remain clean and free from damage.  Keep girders and beams upright and shored.  Support long members on skids spaced to prevent damage from deflection.  Erection.  a.  General.  Provide the falsework and all tools, machinery and appliances, including drift pins and fitting bolts necessary for the expeditious handling of the work.  Before starting work, inform the Engineer as to the method of erection, and the amount and character of equipment proposed to be used, which is subject to the approval of the Engineer.

(See AWS D.2.0 as amended by Circular Memo).  Increase quantity of weld to be inspected if quality of initially inspected weld proves unsatisfactory.  (See AWS D.2.0 as amended by Circular Memo). Radiographing and laboratory report no expense to the Department.  b.  Storage of Materials at Site.  Place material to be stored on skids above the ground.  Keep the material clean, free of graffiti, and properly drained.  Place girders and beams upright and shored.  Support long members, such as columns and chords, on skids placed close enough together to prevent injury from deflection.  If the Contract is for erection only, check the material against the shipping lists and report promptly in writing any shortage or injury discovered.  c.  Falsework.    Design  the  falsework,  and  construct  and  maintain  the  falsework  for  the applicable  loads.    Prepare  and  submit  to  the  Engineer  for  approval  in  writing  plans  for falsework  or  for  changes  in  an  existing  structure  necessary  for  maintaining  traffic. Approval of the plans does not relieve the Contractor of its primary responsibility for the adequacy of the design.  d.  Straightening  Bent  Material  (Field).    Perform  the  straightening  of  plates,  angles,  other shapes, and built-up members, when permitted by the Engineer, by methods that will not produce fracture or other injury to the metal.  Straighten distorted members by mechanical means  or,  if  approved  by  the  Engineer,  by  effective  procedures  and  the  supervised application  of  a  limited  amount  of  localized  heat.    As  an  exception,  perform  the  heat straightening  of  AASHTO  M270  (ASTM  A709)  Grades  70W,  100,  and  100W  steel members  only  under  rigidly  controlled  procedures,  with  each  application  subject  to  the  800-144  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  approval of the Engineer.  Do not allow the maximum temperature to exceed the values in the following table.  Grade  Grade 70W > 6 in. from weld  Grade 70W < 6 in. from weld Grade 100 or 100W > 6 in. from weld Grade 100 or 100W < 6 in. from weld  Max. Temp  1050\u00b0F  900\u00b0F 1100\u00b0F 950\u00b0F  In  all  other  steels, do not allow  the  temperature  of  the  heated  area  to  exceed  1200\u00b0F, as  controlled  and  monitored  by  temperature  indicating  crayons,  liquids,  or  bimetal thermometers or by other methods as approved by the Engineer.  Heating  in  excess  of the limits shown  shall be cause for rejection, unless the Engineer allows testing to verify material integrity.  Ensure that parts to be heat straightened are substantially free of stress and from external forces,  except  stresses  resulting  from  mechanical  means  used  in  conjunction  with  the application of heat.  Evidence of fracture following straightening of a bend or buckle will be cause for rejection of the damaged piece.  e.  Assembling Steel.  Handle the materials so that no parts are bent,  broken, or otherwise damaged.    When  hammering  material,  avoid  damage  or  distortion  of  the  members. Repair  all  damage  to  coatings  according  to  SECTION  825  at  no  additional  cost  to  the Department.  Clean bearing  surfaces  and  surfaces  to  be  in  permanent  contact  before the  members  are  assembled.  Ensure that splices and field connections have one-half of the holes filled with bolts and cylindrical  pins (half bolts and half pins).  Use  fitting-up  bolts  that  are  the  same  nominal  diameter,  and  ensure  that  cylindrical erection pins are 1/32 in. larger.  f.  Bolted  Connections.    Clean  the  surfaces  of  metal  in  contact  before  assembling. Assemble the  parts  of a  member  and ensure that the parts are well  pinned and firmly drawn together before drilling, reaming, or bolting is commenced.  Take apart assembled pieces,  if  necessary,  for  the  removal  of  burrs  and shavings produced by the operation. Ensure that the member is free from twists, bends, and other deformations.  Ensure  that  the  drifting  performed  during  assembly  is  only  that  needed  to  position  the parts and does not enlarge the holes or distort the metal.  For high strength bolted connections, see Subsection 824.03.5.  g.  Field  Welding.  When  field  welding  is  specified, perform the welding  by  the  electric  arc process, and ensure that it conforms to the same requirements in Subsection 824.03.6 with the following modifications.  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-145      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Unless  approved  by  the  Engineer,  do  not  undertake  welding  when  the  ambient temperature is  lower  than  32\u00b0F,  when  surfaces  are  wet  or  exposed  to  rain,  snow,  or high wind, nor when the welders would be exposed to inclement conditions.  h.  Misfits.    The  correction  of  minor  misfits  involving  non-harmful  amounts  of  reaming, cutting,  and  chipping  will  be  considered  a  legitimate  part  of  the  erection.  However, report immediately to the Engineer if  any  error  in  the  shop  fabrication  or  deformation resulting  from  handling  and  transportation  that  prevents  the  proper  assembling  and fitting up of parts by the moderate use of drift pins or by a moderate amount of reaming and  slight  chipping  or  cutting,  and secure  his/her  approval  of  the  method of correction. Make the  correction  in  his/her  presence.  Surface Preparation for Weathering Steel.  a.  Cleaning  After  Fabrication.  After  completion  of  fabrication  operations, blast clean  all steel  surfaces  according  to  SSPC-SP  6,   \u201c Steel  Structures  Painting  Council  Surface Preparation Specification No. 6 - Commercial Blast Cleaning.\u201d  Emphasize the inspection of all exposed surfaces, including the outside face and bottom side of fascia girders and all exposed  fascia welds.  b.  Handling.  Ensure that all steel remains clean.  Ensure that exposed steel  remains  clean of all foreign material such as grease, oil, concrete spatter, chalk marks,  crayon marks, dirt, etc.  Natural oxidation of the steel is not considered foreign matter.  c.  Final  Cleaning.  After  the  deck  is  in  place  and  all  formwork  has  been  removed, inspect the  steel  surfaces for stains, discoloration, and any other deleterious materials that may affect the weathering of the steel in a uniform manner.  Remove stains, discoloration, and any other deleterious materials  on  exterior surfaces of fascia  girders by high  pressure (5000 - 10,000 psi) water cleaning.  If  necessary,  add  a  chemical  cleaning  agent,  with the  approval  of the  Engineer, to the  high-pressure  cleaning  to  remove  staining.  If  high pressure  water  cleaning  does  not  remove  the  stains,  propose  an  alternative  cleaning method,  subject to  the  approval  of  the  Engineer in writing.  Ensure that the surrounding area is protected from contamination.  Avoid any damage to the adjacent concrete.  Once the  final  cleaning  is  accomplished, do not  use  the  structural  steel  for  attachment  or support.  Shear Connectors.  a.  Welding.  End-weld stud  shear  connectors  to  steel  beams  or  girders  (on  axes  parallel to  the  transverse  reinforcement)  with  automatically  timed  stud  welding  equipment connected to a  suitable power source.  Ensure compliance with Subsection 824.03.7.  If two or more stud welding guns will be operated from the same power source, interlock the gunsso that  only  one  gun  can  operate  at  a time  and  so that  the  power  source  has fully recovered  from making one weld before another weld is started.  Do not perform welding when the ambient temperature is below 32\u00b0F or when the surface is  wet or exposed to rain or snow.  800-146  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  While  in  operation,  hold the  welding  gun  in  position  without  movement  until  the  weld metal has solidified.  Ensure that longitudinal  and  lateral  spacings  of  studs  with  respect  to  each  other  and to  edges  of  beam  or  girder flanges do not vary more than \u00bd in. from the dimensions shown  on  the  Plans,  except  that  a  diagonal  variation  of  1  in.  will  be  permitted  where required to  avoid  obstruction  with  other  attachments on the beam or where a new stud is being welded to replace a defective one.  Ensure that the minimum  distance from the edge of a stud to the edge of a beam is 1 in. but preferably not less than 1\u00bd  in.  Bend the first two studs welded on each beam or girder, after being allowed to cool, to 45\u00b0  by  striking  the  stud  with  a  hammer.  If  failure  occurs  in  the  weld  of  either  stud, correct  the  procedure  and attain  two  successive  studs  successfully  welded  and  tested before any more studs are welded to  the beam or girder.  Promptly inform the Engineer of any changes in the welding procedure at  any time during construction.  If  the  reduction  in  the  height  of  studs  as  they  are  welded  becomes  less  than  normal, cease welding immediately and do not resume until the cause has been corrected.  Before  welding  a  new  stud  where  a  defective  one  has  been  removed, ground smooth and  flush  the  area  or,  for  a  pullout  of  metal,  fill  the  pocket  with  weld  metal  using  the shielded metal-arc process with low-hydrogen welding electrodes and then ground flush. In compression areas of flanges, a new stud may be welded adjacent to the defective area in lieu of repair and replacement  on the existing weld area.  b.  Inspection.  If  visual  inspection  reveals  any  stud  that  does  not  show  a  full  360-degree weld, any stud that has been repaired by welding, or any stud in which the reduction in height  due  to  welding is less than normal, strike the stud with a hammer and bend the stud 15 degrees off the vertical.  For studs showing less than a  360-degree weld, ensure that  the  direction  of  bending  is  opposite  to  the  lack  of  weld.  Replace studs that crack either in the weld or the shank.  The Engineer may select additional studs to be subjected to the bend test specified above. The studs tested that show no sign of failure may remain in the bent position.  824.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Structural  Steel is  measured  by the  pounds  of  each  type  and  configuration  provided.  Castings,  forgings,  wrought  iron,  special  alloy  steels,  weld  metal,  and  special  shapes  for expansion  joints,  shear  connectors,  drainage  fixtures,  or  railing  are  considered  as  structural steel even when made of other materials.  Compute the  weight  of  metal  based  on  the  following  unit  weights expressed in pounds per cubic foot:  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION  800-147        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Metal  Unit Weights (lb/cu ft)  Aluminum, cast, or rolled  Bronze or copper alloy  Copper, sheet  Iron, cast  Iron, wrought  Iron, malleable  Lead, sheet  Steel, cast, or rolled, including  alloys, copper bearing, and stainless  Zinc  173.0  536.0  558.0  445.0  487.0  470.0  707.0  490.0  450.0  For the estimated overrun, compute the weight of steel shapes and plates based on  their nominal weights  and  dimensions  as  shown  on  the  approved  Shop  Drawings  and  after  deducting  for open  holes.    An  estimated  overrun  computed  as  one-half  the  \u201cPermissible  Variation  in Thickness  and  Weight\u201d as tabulated in ASTM A6 will be added to all universal mill and sheared plates and slabs.  For high strength bolts and nuts, compute the weight based on the following weights:  Diameter of Bolt Bolts in Inches  Weight per 100 Bolts in Pounds  \u00bd \u215d \u00be \u215e 1 1\u215b 1\u00bc 1\u215c 1\u00bd  19.7 31.7 52.4 80.4 116.7 165.1 212.0 280.0 340.0  Compute the weight of weld metal to the net length called for on the Shop Drawings based on the following table:  Size of Fillet in Inches  Weight in Pounds Per Foot of Weld  3/16 \u00bc 5/16 \u215c \u00bd \u215d \u00be \u215e 1  0.08 0.14 0.22 0.30 0.55 0.80 1.10 1.50 2.00  800-148  SECTION 824 \u2014 STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  If the Contract does not include erection by the fabricator, field welds will not be included.  The  weight  of  temporary  erection  bolts,  shop,  and  field  paint,  galvanizing,  and  material  used for  shipping and erection will not be included.  Compute the  weight  of  castings  from  the  dimensions  shown  on  the  approved Shop Drawings, deducting for open holes.  Add a 5 percent allowance for fillets and overrun.  Scale weights may be  substituted for  computed  weights  for  castings  or for  small complex parts for which accurate computation of weights is difficult.  Surface  preparation for weathering  steel will not  be measured  separately  for  payment.  Welded Stud Shear Connectors will be measured by the number of each  piece  welded  to  steel flanges.  824.05  BASIS OF PAYMENT.

Methods  of  Application.    Use  brushes,  rollers,  spray  equipment,  or  any  combination  of equipment  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  and  authorized  by  the  Engineer  that provides a finish acceptable to the Department.  e.  Stripe Coats.  Apply a stripe coat of primer to corners, weld seams, around nuts and bolts, or as otherwise directed in the Contract Documents.  Do not apply the full coat of primer any sooner than 15 minutes after the application of the stripe coat or any later than the manufacturer\u2019s  recommended  recoat  times.    Notify  Inspection  personnel  and  provide ample time to verify and approve the stripe coat application.  Do not apply the full coat of primer until the Engineer has approved the striping in writing.  The coating material used for  the  stripe  coat  is  typically  the  intermediate  coat  but,  for  painting,  metalizing,  or galvanizing surfaces, the approved finish coat is striped.  f.  Intermediate and Topcoat.  Ensure that the intermediate coat color contrasts with both the primer and topcoat.  Stripe coats may be tinted as necessary to ensure proper coverage. Ensure that coating materials used to apply piece marks are compatible with the existent and any subsequent coats.  g.  Recoat Interval.  Comply with the coating manufacturer\u2019s minimum and maximum recoat interval for each coating layer.  Ensure that each coating layer is sufficiently cured before applying the next scheduled coating layer.  h.  Field Applied Coatings-Touchup of Primer and Intermediate Coat(s).  Before applying field touch-up  coatings,  verify  that  all  surfaces,  including  installed  bolts,  nuts,  and  zinc-rich primer  around  connection  plates,  are  thoroughly  cleaned  of  grease,  oil,  chalk,  bird droppings, lubricants, and other adhesive interference material.  Use pressure washing or solvent  cleaning,  as  appropriate,  to  remove  the  interference  material.    Use  hand  and power tool cleaning for spot repair of localized damage to the coating system.  Pressure wash using 1500 psi water pressure all surfaces primed with zinc-rich primer to remove zinc salts.  Do not proceed with touchup and painting until the Engineer has accepted the surface cleaning.  Repair any damaged areas of coating and reapply all affected coating layers.

Verify that the amount of time between the application of the intermediate and the topcoat is within the coating manufacturer\u2019s recommended maximum recoat time.  Verify that the surface is clean and dry before the application of the topcoat. If grease, oil, or other contaminants become deposited on the intermediate coat, remove it according to SSPC-SP1 before the application of the topcoat.  Comply with Paras. c and d for application.  j.  Removal/Repair of Unsatisfactory Material.  The coating system is unsatisfactory if any of  the following defects are observed:  800-154  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Abrasion damage \u25cf  Peeling \u25cf  Blistering \u25cf  Wrinkling \u25cf  Excessive runs \u25cf  Sags \u25cf  Evidence of application under unfavorable conditions \u25cf  Poor workmanship \u25cf  Use of unauthorized coating material \u25cf  Other defects as determined by the Engineer  Submit  repair  procedures  for  unsatisfactory  material  to  the  Department  for  approval  in writing before performing related work.  Remove and replace unsatisfactory coating layers at no additional cost to the Department as specified below:  \u25cf  Bare Steel Exposed Less Than 4 in. \u00d7 4 in. Area.  When the defective paint or damage extends to the bare steel or if bare steel is exposed in areas less than 4 in. \u00d7 4 in. in size, clean the surface by power tool cleaning according to SSPC-SP11.  Feather the surrounding  paint  to  expose  a  minimum  of  \u00bd  in.  of  each  coat  around  the  entire perimeter of the repair area and to provide a smooth transition into the surrounding intact, adherent material.  Select a primer recommended by the manufacturer for the intermediate and topcoat.  For new steel, apply a spot coat of zinc-rich primer to the prepared surface.  Follow with a spot coat of the intermediate and topcoat.  \u25cf  Bare  Steel  Exposed  Greater  Than  4  in.  \u00d7  4  in.  Area.    When  the  defective  paint  or damage extends to the bare steel in areas greater than 4 in. \u00d7 4 in. in size, blast clean the  area  according  to  SSPC  SP10,  feather  the  surrounding  paint,  and  repair  as described above.  \u25cf  Primer or Intermediate Coat Exposed.  When the damaged or defective paint extends to the  primer  or  intermediate  coat,  and for primed  areas  around  and  on  connection plates, clean the surface by hand or power tool cleaning.  Clean according to SSPC SP2 or SSPC SP3 to remove oxidation, zinc-salts, and contamination from the surface. Do not burnish or polish the surface.  Supplement hand and power tool cleaning with pressure  washing  (1500  psi  minimum)  accompanied  by  scrubbing  with  stiff  bristled brushes or other means as necessary.  Feather the surrounding material to expose a minimum of \u00bd in. of each coat and to provide a smooth transition into the surrounding intact, adherent coating material.  \u25cf  All Repairs.  For all repairs, roughen the paint in overcoat areas with 80 grit sandpaper to ensure good adhesion of the overcoat material to the underlying paint.  Also, solvent clean according to SSPC SP1 and repaint the affected areas with the intermediate and topcoat.  k.  Scaffolding.    Use  rubber  rollers  or  other  protective  devices  to  prevent  damage  to  the finished coatings.  In particular, use sufficient support pads for bracing on fascias.  Do not allow temporary supports or attachments for scaffolding or forms to damage the coating system.  Repair areas damaged by scaffolding according to Para. j above.  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL  800-155      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  l.  Technical Supervision.  The Contractor/fabricator is responsible for securing the services of the technical representative, the services of which will be at no additional cost to the Department.  New Steel Structures.  Work  under  this  paragraph  only  applies  to  structures  being  built  new  or  structures  whose superstructure  is  being  replaced  in  its  entirety.    For  new  steel  used  in  partial  replacement  or rehabilitation, see Subsection 825.03.4.  a.  General.    Use  a  three-coat  system  approved  by  the  Northeast  Protective  Coating Committee (NEPCOAT), or as described in Subsection 825.03.5, and that conforms to SECTION M06 and the following:  \u25cf  Exterior  Steel  Surfaces.    Use  a  system  that  consists  of  a  prime  coat,  intermediate  stripe coat, intermediate coat, and topcoat.  \u25cf  Interior Steel Surfaces.  Use a coating system for the interior surfaces, such as open box girders, arch ribs and ties, and tubular wind bracing, that consists of a two-coat NEPCOAT exterior system and contrasts with the primer.  This system contains a zinc- rich primer and intermediate coat.  Select the same primer and intermediate coat for application to both interior and exterior surfaces of the same steel member.  Interior surfaces  require  no  topcoat.    Use  white for the  intermediate coat  applied  to  interior surfaces.  b.  Priming Faying Surfaces.  Ensure that the coatings applied to contact surfaces of bolted connections  between  primary  members  comply  with  the  AASHTO  LRFD  Bridge Construction  Specifications.    Use  a  coating  system  for  faying  surfaces  that  has  a  slip coefficient of Class B.  Before shop bolting, verify that the coating on faying surfaces is applied  at  the  recommended  dry film  thickness and  that  the temperature  adjusted  cure time for  shop  and field  slip  critical  bolted  faying surfaces  is  within  the range  previously validated through testing by the applicator\u2019s QC person or as given by NEPCOAT.  Verify the cure according to ASTM D 4752 or the manufacturer\u2019s requirements.  Apply the zinc-rich primer to all surfaces.  Do not apply intermediate and topcoats to faying surfaces, connection areas, or within 2 in. of a connection area that will be welded.  Mask or  otherwise  protect  these  surfaces  to  prevent  the  application  of  intermediate  and topcoats.    Zinc-rich  primer  is  not  allowed  on  flange  surfaces  that  will  be  embedded  in concrete, although overspray is allowed on the flange surfaces.  Apply the topcoat to the same surfaces coated with the intermediate coat, except those surfaces that will be embedded in concrete.  c.  Bolts (Fasteners).  Prepare bolts installed and final tightened before priming as necessary so  that,  after  the  steel  is  abrasive  blast  cleaned,  exposed  bolt  surfaces  will  satisfy  the requirements in the Table below.  Black bolts, nuts, and washers, including flat faces of nuts  and  bolt  heads  facing  adjacent  material,  may  require  spot  blast  cleaning  or  other surface preparation before general blast cleaning to ensure that the proper surface profile to obtain adhesion of the primer has been achieved.  800-156  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Surface Preparation Requirements for Fasteners and Bolts  Fasteners Installed Before Cleaning & Primer Application  Fasteners Installed After Primer Application  Item  Coating System  Surface Preparation  Coating System  Surface Preparation  Black Iron Bolts  OZ or IOZ, I, T  SSPC-SP10  IOZ, OZ, I, T  SSPC-SP 1 & 10  OZ or IOZ, I, T  SSPC-SP 1  I, T  SSPC-SP 1 & 2/3  Galvanized (Mechanical or Hot Dip)  Key:  \u2022  OZ  =   Organic Zinc-Rich Primer \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  IOZ = I   = T  =   Topcoat  Inorganic Zinc-Rich Primer Intermediate Coat  If the zinc  coating  on  shop-installed  galvanized bolts  is  damaged  during  shop  abrasive blast cleaning or tightening, the coating may remain as is only if the entire coating system (including the zinc-rich primer) will be applied over the fasteners.  Remove the lubricant from bolts.  Obtain from the fabricator the identity of solvents and methods needed to remove the lubricant.  Consult with the coating supplier to assess the compatibility of the coating with any lubricant residue.  Supply  to  the  shop  and  field  painters,  the  Engineer,  and  other  interested  parties  the information  concerning  the  lubricant  removal  and  the  cleanliness  necessary  for satisfactory adhesion of the subsequent coat as described in the Table above.  Use  a  white  cloth  wipe  test  with  no  color  transfer  to  confirm  that  all  lubricant  and  non- absorbed dye has been removed; only residual stain is permitted to remain on the surface.  d.  Shipping, Storage, and Erection of Steel.  When handling, storing, shipping, and erecting the steel, avoid damage to the coating system.  Do not move coated steel in the shop until sufficient cure time has elapsed to ensure that no damage will be done to the fresh coating. Do not ship the steel from the shop to the field until the last coating has fully cured.  Install padding on hooks and slings used to hoist the steel, and use softeners approved by the Engineer to insulate the steel from binding chains.  Place small structural pieces in so that no rubbing will occur during shipment.  Store the steel at the job site on pallets or by other means to prevent members from resting directly on the ground or from falling onto each other.  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL  800-157        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Existing Steel Structures.  Work  under  this  section  is  only  applicable  to  structures  that  are  not  addressed  under Subsection 825.03.3.  a.  Protection of Painted Surfaces.  Protect freshly coated surfaces and those surfaces not scheduled for painting from over blast and stray abrasive during blast cleaning operations. Clean any previously coated surfaces damaged by subsequent blast cleaning operations according to SSPC SP10 and recoated according to this specification.  b.  Surface Preparation.  Obtain the Engineer\u2019s approval of the preparation of all surfaces to  be painted before applying any paint.  Surface preparation and coating requirements are dependent upon the scope of work and the  type  and  condition  of  the  existing  coating  system.    The  Table  below  provides  the required surface preparation methods for four scenarios.  Use the specific coating material requirements for each surface preparation method in SECTION M06.  Surface Preparation Methods for Spot, Zone and Overcoating1  Scope of Work  Surface Preparation  Existing Coating System  Spot Prime and Overcoat  Spot Prime and Overcoat  Method 1  Alkyd Coatings  Method 2  Zinc-rich or Metalizing/Galvanizing with Topcoat  Zone Painting  Method 3  Alkyd Coatings  Zone Painting  Method 3 or Method 4  Zinc-rich or Metalizing/Galvanizing with Topcoat  1.  Ensure  that  the  surface  preparation  methods  are  according  to  the  paint  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations,  unless  the  requirements  in  this  Table  exceed  the  manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  In case of conflict, use the more stringent surface preparation methods as determined by the Engineer.  c.  Method  1:    Spot  Prime  and  Overcoat  an  Existing  Alkyd  Coating  System.    Spot  clean localized areas of corrosion or coating breakdown using vacuum shrouded power tools according  to  SSPC-SP3,  \u201cPower  Tool  Cleaning.\u201d    Feather  the  edges  of  the  power  tool cleaned areas.  Prepare the intact alkyd coating for overcoating by cleaning according to Low-Pressure Water Cleaning (LP WC) of SSPC-SP12.  The minimum acceptable water pressure is 1500 psi.  Use low pressure water cleaning to remove chalk, pigeon droppings, dirt, and other deleterious materials from the surface.  d.  Method 2:  Spot Prime and Overcoat an Existing Coating System.  Spot clean localized areas of corrosion or coating breakdown using vacuum shrouded power tools according to  SSPC-SP11,  \u201cPower  Tool  Cleaning  to  Bare  Metal,\u201d  or  using  vacuum  blast  cleaning equipment according to SSPC-SP10, \u201cNear White Blast Cleaning.\u201d  Feather the edges of the repaired area.  Prepare the intact topcoats (epoxies or urethanes) for overcoating by hand sanding to roughen the surface.  800-158  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  e.  Method 3:  Abrasive Blast Clean.  To remove all coating material from a well-defined zone (portion of the structure).  Blast clean steel according to SSPC SP10, \u201cNear White Blast Cleaning.\u201d  Ensure that the surface area of the steel to be blast cleaned is no greater than the  surface  area  of  steel  that  can  be  primed  during  the  same  day.    Ensure  that  the maximum time lapse between surface preparation and application of the prime coat is not greater than eight hours, unless atmospheric controls are used to prevent \u201crust back.\u201d  If any \u201crust back\u201d occurs before priming, reclean surfaces to provide the specified degree of cleanliness.  Ensure that the abrasive blast profile meets the manufacturer\u2019s requirements as stated on the product data sheets.  f.  Method 4:  Water Wash and Ultrahigh Pressure Water Clean.  Use in a well-defined zone (portion  of  the  structure).    Pressure  wash  all  surfaces  in  the  zone  that  will  be  coated, including areas of limited access such as crevices between back to back angles.  Use low pressure  washing  to  remove  the  loose  debris,  followed  by  ultrahigh  pressure  water cleaning to remove all existing coating and corrosion from the steel surfaces scheduled to be  coated.    Comply  with  the  requirements  of  SSPC-SP  12,  \u201cSurface  Preparation  and Cleaning of Steel and Other Hard Materials by High- and Ultrahigh-Pressure Water Jetting Before Recoating.\u201d  Ensure that cleaned steel surfaces that will be painted conform to the Visual Surface Preparation Definitions of the surface condition WJ-3 in SSPC SP12.  Do not use rust inhibitors.  Reclean steel surfaces not primed within 72 hours by water jetting. Collect all water and paint chips dislodged by the water cleaning process.  Use potable filtered water for the washing to achieve a surface that is free of paint, corrosion, and other visible  contaminates.    Measure  the  non-visible  contaminant  and  remove  according  to SSPC-Guide 15 to ensure that detectable chloride levels are less than 10 micrograms per square centimeter.  g.  Limited Access Areas.  The design of the structure may create areas of limited access that cannot be cleaned to the specified degree of surface preparation across every square inch of the surface.  In these cases, provide surface preparation as follows.  Clean all areas that can be viewed without the use of mirrors to the specified degree of cleanliness.  Localized areas of limited access due to the configuration of the structure may  prevent  the  specified  degree  of  cleanliness  from  being  achieved.    At  a  minimum, remove all loose coatings in these areas.  Inspect the surfaces by touch, using a putty knife  and  inspection  mirrors,  optical  or  digital  scopes.    Cleaning  and  painting  of  these areas may require the use of specialized equipment.  If the limited access area is a crevice or gap from which pack rust cannot be removed such as between mating plates, between back-to-back  angles,  or between  structural  members,  apply  sealants/caulks  to  seal  the top and side surfaces to prevent moisture intrusion.  Do not caulk the bottom crevice.  Use sealants/caulks compatible with the coating system and provide written verification from the coating manufacturer on the compatibility of the sealant/caulk with the coating.  Painting Metalized or Galvanized Surfaces.  Use a coating system that is an approved NEPCOAT system and conforms to SECTION M06. The zinc-rich primer is not required for metalized or galvanized surfaces.  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL  800-159      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Prepare galvanizing according to SSPC SP-16 before painting.  Remove white corrosion deposits, such  as  wet  storage  stains,  before  coating.    Overcoat  with  any  of  the  NEPCOAT  approved intermediate coats followed by applying the compatible NEPCOAT-approved topcoat.  The natural profile of metalized surface will not require any surface preparation.  For any process that reduces the metalized or galvanized thickness below the specification limit, remove and re-apply the metalize or galvanize, as applicable, to meet the specification.  Apply the intermediate coat to the surface as soon as possible after the Engineer has accepted the  metalizing  or  galvanizing  surface  preparation  and  no  later  than  eight  hours  after  the preparation.    If  more  than  eight  hours  elapses,  provide  written  recommendations  from  the intermediate coat manufacturer that identify the required steps to compensate for any oxidation and make the surface suitable for the intermediate coat application.  Do not implement the steps without written approval from the Engineer.  Apply a stripe coat of urethane to all edges of bolted connections and other areas followed by a full approved finish coat of urethane.  Stenciling of Topcoat.  After the topcoat has fully cured, provide stencil information on the inside surface of the fascia member at each abutment location.  Use suitable black paint or other color as approved by the Engineer to contrast with the topcoat for visibility.  Stencil uniform block lettering on the surface, 2 in. to 3 in. in height, with the following information:  \u2022  The bridge identification number as shown on the Plans  \u2022  The month and year of completion of the coating system (MM/YYYY)  \u2022  The SSPC identification of the cleaning method  \u2022  Identification  of  the  coating  system  (for  example:  IOZ/OZ,  E,  U)  with  the  name  of  the manufacturer; use the following designations:  IOZ = Inorganic Zinc Rich Primer  \u25cb \u25cb  OZ = Organic Zinc Rich Primer \u25cb  M = Metalized \u25cb  G = Galvanized \u25cb  E = Epoxy \u25cb  U = Urethane  Lighting.  Provide  adequate  lighting  for  all  surface  preparation,  paint  application,  and  inspection  work. Maintain a minimum of 10 ft-candles for surface preparation and painting, and a minimum of 30 ft-candles  of  general  area  lighting  for  inspection.    Increase  the  lighting  if  workers  or  other personnel have difficulty seeing.  Use explosion-proof lighting.  Quality Control.  Document and conduct an on-going Quality Control plan for the process and for the inspection of the materials, surface preparation, coating applications storage, and shipping of components as  800-160  SECTION 825 \u2014 PAINTING STRUCTURAL STEEL        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  necessary to ensure that all work is performed in compliance with the Contract Documents and the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.

The Engineer will measure the depth of concrete removal.  5.  If  the  adjustment  is  such  that  the  machine  is  removing  too  much  or  too  little  concrete, calibrate the machine  and  repeat  the  above  procedure  as many  times  as  necessary  to achieve the required depth.  6.  Perform one test for each stage of deck surface concrete removal.  Ensure  that  the  equipment  is  operated  by  qualified  personnel  certified  by  the  equipment manufacturer.  Submit the operator certification to the Engineer for approval before beginning the concrete removal operation.  Ensure  the  availability  of  service  personnel  and  an  inventory  of  common  wear  parts  and replacement accessories for the equipment to guarantee that the removal operation will not be interrupted for an extended period of time if an equipment breakdown occurs.  Submit a list of operating parameters to be used for the hydrodemolition work to the Engineer before the commencement of concrete removal.  Once the operating parameters are established by programming or calibration, do not change the parameters as the machine progresses across the bridge deck except to prevent unnecessary removal of sound concrete below the required minimum removal depth.  If, after calibrating the hydrodemolition equipment and beginning production work in a specific area, insufficient removal of  concrete  is  being  obtained,  recalibrate  the  equipment  for  that  area  to  ensure  removal  of concrete to the specified depth.  Remove any areas of the prepared surface that have been contaminated by oil or other materials detrimental to maintaining a good bond to the depth required.  Perform the cleaning or removal at no additional cost to the Department, and assume responsibility for any resulting delays.  Control of Debris and Water.  Provide structurally adequate shields so that the water jet and broken concrete will not be a hazard to workers, traffic on adjacent lanes, or pedestrians and property below or adjacent to the bridge. Continually  drain  the  water  from  the  bridge,  and  ensure  that  the  excess  water  does  not accumulate to avoid damaging the area below the bridge.  Remove all debris immediately following the hydrodemolition operation by employing a vacuum recovery system to prevent rebonding to the remaining surface.  Remove all debris that resettles or rebonds to the surface of the sound concrete.  Avoid damage to the remaining sound concrete and reinforcing steel.  SECTION 840 \u2014 DECK SURFACE CONCRETE REMOVAL BY HYDRODEMOLITION  800-195      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Use methods for the control, maintenance, and disposal of hydrodemolition runoff that conform to SECTION 214.  Ensure  that the runoff  control features  are  in  place  and  operational  before  beginning  concrete removal.  Prevent runoff across traveled way, into bridge drainage devices, or into areas below or adjacent to the bridge, except for the containment basin.  Reinforcing Steel.  Following the hydrodemolition operation, inspect all exposed reinforcing steel to ensure that it has been cleaned of all rust and corrosive products, including oil, dirt, concrete fragments, laitance, loose  scale,  and  other  coatings  that  could  destroy  or  inhibit  the  bond  with  the  new  concrete. Reclean exposed reinforcing steel not adequately cleaned by the initial hydrodemolition process. If the bars are deteriorated such that they have lost 25 percent or more of their original diameter, replace the steel as specified according to either the Contract or SECTION 818.  When cleaned reinforcing steel is exposed for more than seven calendar days, protect the steel from contamination by the type of materials listed above.  A light coating of rust can be expected to form on the reinforcing; this is not considered contamination.  Concrete Placement.  Conduct the placement and finishing of concrete for deck repairs and deck overlays as specified in SECTION 818.  840.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.

Ensure that the calibration tests have  been  performed  and  certified  by  an  independent  testing  laboratory  within  90 calendar days of the date submitted.  Obstructions.  When  obstructions  are  encountered  during  the  installation  of  micropiles,  notify  the  Engineer. Make all reasonable efforts to install the piles at the required location and to the proper depth. Excavate to remove the obstruction or employ all usual methods to install piles.  Do not relocate piles until the Contractor submitted Shop Drawings have been approved by the Engineer.  Allowable Construction Tolerances and Acceptance Criteria.  Ensure that:  \u2022  The center of gravity of the entire group of micropiles at an individual abutment is not more  than 2 in. from the required center of gravity for the group.  \u2022  The centerline of piling is not more than 3 in. from the required location.  \u2022  The pile is plumb within 2 percent of the total-length plan alignment.  \u2022  The top elevation of pile is plus 1 in. or minus 2 in. maximum from the required vertical  elevation.  \u2022  The centerline of reinforcing steel is not more than \u00be in. from the required location.  The Engineer will not accept piles that are damaged or defective due to defective materials or an improper  installation  procedure,  or  piles  that  have  an  installed  volume  of  cement  grout  not exceeding a volume equal to 110 percent of the theoretical volume of the drill hole.  Cut off piles that are damaged or defective 1 ft below bottom of footing elevation, and document on  the  as-built  drawing.    Replace  these  piles  by  additional  pile(s)  installed  adjacent  to  the removed/abandoned  pile,  and  ensure replacement  piles  comply  with that Subsection  844.03.3.   Install  the replacement  pile(s)  where  the center  of  gravity  of  the  group complies with the location criteria above.  The Engineer must approve in writing any modification that necessitates changes to the structure.  the  800-212  SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Correct piles that are mislocated beyond the specified tolerances by installing an additional pile at no additional cost to the Department.  Ensure that the center of gravity of the combination of the two piles is within the location tolerance for the original location and the allowable tolerance for the abutment.  Installation.  Select  the  drilling  method,  the  grouting  procedure,  and  the  grouting  pressure  used  for  the installation  of  the  micropiles.    Determine  the  micropile  casing  size,  final  drillhole  diameter  and bond  length,  and  central  reinforcement  steel  sizing  necessary  to  develop  the  specified  load capacities and load testing requirements.  Estimate the grout take.  Ensure  that  the  drillhole  is  open  along  its  full  length  to  at  least  the  design  minimum  drillhole diameter before placing grout and reinforcement.  Use temporary casing or other method of pile drillhole support in caving or unstable ground to permit the pile shaft to be formed to the minimum design drillhole diameter.  The Engineer will review  and  approve  the  proposed  method(s)  to  provide  drillhole  support  and  to  prevent detrimental  ground  movements.    Detrimental  ground  movement  is  defined  as  movement  that requires remedial repair measures.  Do not use drilling fluid containing bentonite.  During construction, observe the conditions in the vicinity of the micropile construction site on a daily basis for signs of ground heave or subsidence, and immediately notify the Engineer if signs of movements are observed.  Immediately suspend or modify drilling or grouting operations if:  \u2022  Ground heave or subsidence is observed \u2022  The micropile structure is adversely affected \u2022  Adjacent structures are damaged from the drilling or grouting  If the Engineer determines that the movements require corrective action, take corrective actions necessary to stop the movement or perform repairs.  Immediately  before  grouting,  ensure  that  the  hole  is  flushed  with  clean  water  to  remove  all contaminated water and cuttings with the grout pipe located at the bottom of the hole.  Pump the water at a high velocity until the wash water at the top of the casing is clear.  Place  reinforcement  into  the  drillhole  before  grouting  and  before  temporary  casing  (if  used)  is withdrawn.  Ensure that the reinforcement surface is free of deleterious substances such as soil, mud, grease, or oil.  Ensure that pile cages and reinforcement groups, if used, can withstand the installation  and  grouting  process  and  the  withdrawal  of  the  drill  casings  without  damage  or disturbance.  Check pile top elevations and adjust all installed micropiles to the required elevations.  Provide centralizers and spacers at a maximum 10-ft on center spacing to provide a minimum 2 in.  of  grout  cover  over  all  steel  reinforcing.    Locate  the  upper  and  lower  most  centralizer  a maximum of 5 ft from the top and bottom of the micropile.  Ensure that centralizers and spacers permit the free flow of grout without misalignment of the reinforcing bar(s) and permanent casing. Lower the central reinforcement bars with centralizers into the stabilized drillhole and set.  Insert the reinforcing steel into the drill hole to the desired depth without difficulty.  Do not drive or force  SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES  800-213       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  partially  inserted  reinforcing  bars  into  the  hole.    Redrill  and  reinsert  reinforcing  steel  when necessary to facilitate insertion.  Secure the lengths of casing and reinforcing bars to be spliced in proper alignment and to avoid eccentricity or angle between the axes of the two lengths to be spliced.  Locate threaded pipe casing  joints  at  least  two  casing  diameters  (OD)  from  a  splice  in  any  reinforcing  bar.    When multiple bars are used, stagger bar splices at least 12 in.  Grout the micropiles the same day that the load transfer bond length is drilled.  Use a stable, neat, cement grout or a sand cement grout with a minimum 28-day unconfined compressive strength of 4000 psi.  Mix admixtures, if used, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.  Ensure that the grouting equipment produces a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement.  Measure the grout quantity and pumping pressure during the grouting operations.  Equip the grout pump with a pressure gauge to monitor grout pressures.  Place a second pressure gauge at the point of injection into the pile top.  Ensure that the pressure gauges can measure pressures of at least 150  psi  or  twice the  actual  grout  pressures  used,  whichever  is  greater.   Ensure  that the  grout remains  in  agitation  before  placing.    Place  grout  within  one  hour  of  mixing.    Size  the  grouting equipment to enable each pile to be grouted in one continuous operation.  Inject  the  grout  from  the  lowest  point  of  the  drill  hole,  and  continue  the  injection  until uncontaminated grout flows from the top of the pile.  The grout may be pumped through grout tubes,  casing,  hollow-stem  augers,  or  drill  rods.    Extract  temporary  casing,  if  used,  in  stages ensuring that, after each length of casing is removed, the grout level is elevated to the ground level before the next length is removed.  Ensure that the tremie pipe or casing always extends below the level of the existing grout in the drillhole.  Control the grout pressures and grout takes to prevent excessive heave or fracturing of rock or soil formations.  Upon completion of grouting, the grout tube may remain in the hole but must be filled with grout.  Allow the grout within the micropiles to attain the required design strength before being loaded.  If the Contractor elects to use a post-grouting system, submit the working drawings and details to the Engineer for review and approval.  Ensure  that the  grout  within  the micropile  verification  and  proof test  piles  attains  the minimum required three-day compressive strength of 2000 psi before load testing.  During production, test the  micropile  grout  for  compressive  strength  according  to  AASHTO  T106/ASTM  C109  at  a frequency of no less than one set of three 2-in. grout cubes from each grout plant each day of operation  or  for  every  10  piles,  whichever  occurs  more  frequently.    Complete  unconfined compressive testing at three, seven, and 28 days.  Use the average of the three cubes tested for the compressive strength.  Take grout samples directly from the onsite grout plant.  Provide grout cube compressive strength and grout density test results to the Engineer within 24 hours of testing.  Install  micropiles  under  the  full-time  inspection  of  the  Engineer  or  authorized  representative. Notify the Engineer a minimum of 48 hours before any initiating any micropile operations.  The Engineer will not accept any pile installed when the representative of the Engineer is not present to obtain the necessary records.  Install additional pile(s) to replace any pile(s) constructed without the presence of the Engineer, as directed, and at no additional cost to the Department.  800-214  SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Installation Records.  Submit to the Engineer full-length installation records for each micropile installed within one work shift  after  that  pile  installation  is  completed.    Record  the  data  on  the  micropile  installation  log. Provide a separate log for each micropile.  Submit for approval a pile numbering plan identifying a  unique  pile  designation  number  for  each  micropile.    The  Engineer  will  keep  an  independent record of each micropile installation.  Ensure that each micropile installation log includes the following information:  \u2022  Top of pile elevation immediately after installation to the nearest 0.1 ft \u2022  Pile cut-off elevation as installed to the nearest 0.1 ft \u2022  Bottom of pile casing elevation to the nearest 0.1 ft \u2022  Pile tip elevation as installed to the nearest 0.1 ft \u2022  Deviation from specified plan location in inches to the nearest \u00bd in. \u2022  Pile length immediately after installation to the nearest 0.1 ft \u2022  Pile designation number \u2022  Damage (if any) to pile and any required corrective action taken \u2022  Grout takes and pressures  Verification Testing.  Before  starting  the  work,  submit  to  the  Engineer  for  approval  a  pile  load  test  plan  including  a written description of the equipment and methods to be used.  Ensure that the methods are an approved type and are revised as necessary to meet the approval of the Engineer.  Ensure that the pile load test plan and description are stamped by a Professional Engineer registered in the State of Rhode Island.  Design the testing reaction frame to be sufficiently rigid and of adequate dimensions such that excessive deformation of the testing equipment does not occur.  Ensure that this determination, and  the  possible  design  of  any  required  bracing,  are  performed  by  a  Professional  Engineer registered  in  the  State  of  Rhode  Island.    Submit  the  calculations,  procedures,  and  working drawings stamped by the Professional Engineer for approval before the start of any load test work.  Construct the test pile consistent with the production piles.  Ensure that the drilling and grouting method, casing length and outside diameter, reinforcing bar lengths, and depth of rock socket for the test micropile are consistent with the specifications for the production piles, increasing steel sizes  as  needed  for  test  loads.    Size  the  verification  test  micropile  structural  steel  sections  to safely resist the maximum test load.  The testing can be performed as a tension or compression test using other piles, earth anchors, or  dead  load  as  reaction.    Perform  compression  load  testing  according  to  ASTM  D1143,  and perform tension load testing according to ASTM D3689, except as modified herein.  Perform  pile  load  testing  to  verify  the  design  of  the  pile  system  and  the  construction  methods proposed before the installation of any production piles.  Construct the test piles in conformance with the approved working drawings at the required locations.  Perform load tests to verify that the installed micropiles will meet the required load capacities and load test acceptance criteria and to verify that the length of the micropile bond zone is adequate.  SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES  800-215       Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  The micropile load test results must verify the Contractor\u2019s design and installation methods and be reviewed and accepted by the Engineer before the installation of production micropiles.  Ensure  that  the  maximum  test  loads  applied  to  the  micropile  do  not  exceed  80  percent  of  the structural capacity of the micropile structural elements, including steel yield in tension, steel yield or buckling in compression, or grout crushing in compression.  If there is any required increase in strength of the verification test pile elements above the strength required for the production piles, provide this at no additional cost to the Department.  Position the jack at the beginning of the test so that unloading and repositioning during the test will not be required.  Use testing equipment that includes dial gauges, dial gauge support, jack and pressure gauge, electronic  load  cell,  and  a  reaction  frame.    Provide  a  description  of  the  test  setup  and  jack, pressure gauge, and load cell calibration curves.  Design  the  testing  reaction  frame  to  be  sufficiently  rigid  and  of  adequate  dimensions  so  that excessive deformation of the testing equipment does not occur.  Align the jack, bearing plates, and stressing anchorage so that unloading and repositioning of the equipment will not be required during the test.  Apply  the test  load  and measure  using  a  hydraulic  jack  and  pressure  gauge.   Use  a  pressure gauge that is graduated in 100 psi increments or less.  Use a jack and pressure gauge that have a pressure range not exceeding twice the anticipated maximum test pressure.  Ensure that the jack ram travel allows the test to be performed without resetting the equipment.  Monitor the creep test load hold during testing with both the pressure gauge and the electronic load cell.  Use the load cell to accurately maintain a constant load hold during the creep test load hold increment of the test.  Provide an independently supported reference beam with supports firmly embedded in the ground at a distance of between 8 ft to 10 ft from the test pile.  Ensure that one end of the reference beam is free to move as the length of the beam changes due to temperature variations.  Measure pile top movement using three dial gauges mounted equidistant from the center of the test pile at 120\u00b0 intervals around the pile.  Rigidly attach the dial gauges to the reference beam. Vertically align the gauge stems on a smooth glass horizontal bearing surface.  Ensure that the dial gauges can measure to 0.001 in. and have a travel sufficient to allow the test to be performed without having to reset the gauge.  Establish reference points on the test pile at each end or at the center of the reference beam and on critical points of the reaction frame.  Ensure that the reference points include graduated scales machine  divided  into  0.02  in.  and  attached  securely  to  the  pile,  reference  beam,  and  other locations.  Monitor the reference points during the pile load test.  Protect the pile movement measuring system against rain, wind, frost, and any other disturbances that  could  affect  the  reliability  of  the  movement  measurements.    Provide  sun  shading  for  the measuring system for the duration of the test and for a minimum of one hour before the start of the test.  800-216  SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  Install two telltales, one extending to the bottom of the test pile and a second extending to the bottom of the cased section or top of the bond zone.  Use the telltales to determine movement at the top of the bond zone and at the pile tip.  The Micropile Contractor\u2019s Engineer will record the required load test data, and the Engineer will keep an independent record of the data.  Test the piles to a maximum test load of 2.0 times the required micropile design load shown on the Plans or working drawings.

SECTION 844 \u2014 MICROPILES  800-217          Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  The acceptance criteria for micropile verification load tests are:  \u2022  Ensure that the pile sustains the first compression or tension 1.0 DL test load with no more than 0.50 in. total vertical movement at the top of the pile, relative to the position of the top of the pile before testing.  \u2022  At the end of the 1.30 DL creep test load increment, ensure that test piles have a creep rate not exceeding 0.04 in./log cycle time (1 to 10 minutes) or 0.08 in./log cycle time (6 to 60  minutes  or  the  last  log  cycle  if  held  longer).    Ensure  that  the  creep  rate  is  linear  or decreasing throughout the creep load hold period.  \u2022  Take  the  maximum  test  load  as  50  percent  of  the  applied  test  load  that  results  in  a movement  under  load  of  0.5  in.  at  the  pile  tip.    Measure  the  movement  at  the  pile  tip directly by the telltale.  \u2022  Failure does not occur at the 2.0 DL maximum test load.  Failure is defined as the load  where the slope of the load vs. head settlement curve first exceeds 0.025 in./kip.  The Engineer will provide written confirmation of the micropile design and construction methods for production piles within three working days of the submission of the micropile load test results report.  Do not install production piles until approved by the Engineer.  If  a  tested  micropile  fails  to  meet  the  acceptance  criteria,  modify  the  design,  the  construction procedure, or both, which may include modifying the installation methods, increasing the bond length, or changing the micropile type.  The Engineer must provide a prior review and approval for any modification that necessitates changes to the structure.  Any modifications of design or construction procedures or cost of additional piles and load testing shall be at the Contractor\u2019s expense.  Test piles may be used as production piles provided that no failure has occurred.  Cut off piles that are not used as production piles as indicated in the Contract and at least 1 ft below the bottom of the footing elevation and document on the as-built drawing.  Proof Testing.  Protect the pile movement measuring system against rain, wind, frost, and any other disturbances that  could  affect  the  reliability  of  the  movement  measurements.

Ensure that the bottom of the shaft slopes uniformly and  is  free  of depressions  exceeding  0.25  ft  deeper  than  the  adjacent  surfaces.  Ensure that the cutting  edges  of  excavation  equipment  are  normal  to  the  vertical  axis  of  the equipment within a tolerance of \u215c in. per foot of diameter.  \u25cf  Evaluation  of  the  shaft  installation  at  any  stage  may  be  made  by  the Engineer. Measure  the  depth  to  the  bottom  of  the  shaft  bearing  stratum  at  the  request  of  the Engineer  to  determine  compliance  with the  specification  requirements.    If  the Engineer concludes that the  bedrock  at  the  foundation  bearing  level  cannot  support the  design  load,  the  Engineer  may  request  the  Contractor  to  drill  deeper.  Do not concrete the drilled shafts until the hole has been observed,  evaluated, and approved by the Engineer in writing.  \u25cf  Upon  initial  contact  with  bedrock,  regardless  of  the  depth  and  rock  quality,  cease  drilling and notify  the  Engineer,  who  will  determine  the  actual  depth.  \u25cf  If  an  obstruction  is  encountered,  notify  the  Engineer  immediately.  Obstructions are defined as natural, man-made, or man-placed objects, materials, or structures (e.g., granite  blocks,  concrete,  timber,  logs,  piles,  cobbles,  boulders)  encountered  at  or below  ground surface that unavoidably and completely halt the progress of the shaft excavation  or  subsurface  drilling  work  for  more  than  one  hour  per  incident  as determined  by  the  Engineer.  These efforts include adjustment of drilling rate, down pressure,  change  of  drill  tools,  and  use  of  chisel  tools  to  break  past  or  remove the obstruction.  Probe to locate the extent of  any obstruction and propose a method of passing or removing it.  \u25cf  Do not consider as obstructions any drilling  tools  that  are  lost  in  the  excavation. Remove  these tools.  Repair the hole when removal operations cause damage.  Tool removal and hole repairs will be at no additional cost to the Department.  b.  Groundwater Control.  \u25cf  Provide groundwater control using drilling slurry and permanent casing, if necessary.  \u25cf  If  dewatering  is  required,  coordinate  with  RIDOT,  the  Rhode  Island  Department  of Environmental  Management  (RIDEM),  all  utility  companies,  and  municipal  or  other agencies,  including  agencies  governing  the  discharge  of  water  from  dewatering operations.  c.  Inspection.  \u25cf  The  approximate  design  bottom  elevation  of  the  drilled  shafts  is  based  on  design criteria developed by the Engineer using subsurface conditions shown on the boring logs.  The Engineer may adjust the required bottom elevation based on the elevation and  quality  of  the  bearing  material  encountered  during  drilling  of  more  recent  test  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS  800-231     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  borings and during installation of the drilled shafts.  The Engineer will be the sole judge for classifying the material encountered.  \u25cf  Sound, measure, and record the depth to the final bottom of shaft in the presence of the Engineer to verify that soil or sediment from the sides of the shaft has not fallen into the shaft and collected on the shaft bottom.  Ensure that the maximum depth of sediment does not exceed 1\u00bd in. with at least 50 percent of the base with no more than \u00bd in. of sediment.  Perform depth measurements at the following times:  \u25cb  Immediately after excavation has been performed to the final depth.  \u25cb  Immediately after the excavation has been cleaned of all loose material and has been desanded.  \u25cb  Immediately before placing reinforcing steel in the slurry-filled shaft.  \u25cb  During  installation  of  the  reinforcing  cage  through  dedicated  access  tubes, location,  and  type  to  be  proposed  by  the  Contractor  and  reviewed  by  the Geotechnical Engineer.  \u25cb  Immediately before concrete placement.  \u25cf  Ensure that the average measured depth at each stage does not vary by more than +0.1 ft or -0.2 ft.  Record and average a minimum of six, equally spaced soundings to determine the depth.  The Engineer will investigate the measurements that exceed the tolerances.  Complete any additional cleaning or drilling until the measurements satisfy the specified tolerances.  Ensure that water at the base of the shaft does not exceed 3 in. before the placement of concrete.  \u25cf  Before placement of reinforcing steel and concrete, ensure that loose material from the bottom and sides of the excavation has been removed and that the shaft is within the specified tolerances.  Remove all loose material at the bottom of shaft.  Document the  drilled  shaft  excavation  dimensions  vs.  depth  and  verticality  using  the  specified monitoring device to verify that the shaft is within the specified tolerances.  d.  Monitoring.    Provide  monitoring  devices  and  qualified  technicians  for  monitoring  the  following:  \u25cf  Shaft Bottom Cleanliness.  Use the Shaft Inspection Device (SID) as manufactured by  GPE, Inc. of Gainesville, Florida or approved equivalent.  \u25cf  Shaft Verticality Measurement Device.  Provide equipment and a qualified technician for  monitoring  the  dimensions  and  verticality  of  drilled  shaft  excavations.    At  a minimum, take measurements using equipment attached to the top of the drill rig (Kelly bar).  \u25cf  Shaft Diameter Measurement Device.  Provide equipment and a qualified technician for  monitoring  the  dimensions  of  drilled  shaft  excavations.    Provide  sonic  caliper technology or approved equivalent.  800-232  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS     Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  e.  Mineral Slurry Level.  Maintain the level of mineral slurry at not less than 4 ft above the  highest observed piezometric pressure head at all times during excavation.  f.  Polymer Slurry.  Maintain the level of polymer slurry at a level not less than 6 ft above the  highest observed piezometric head.  Installation of Casings.  a.  Permanent Casing.  Furnish and install permanent casing that will remain in place and is included in the design of the drilled shaft.  Permanent casing may be oversized up to 3 in. if necessary to facilitate temporary casing installation.  Comply with the following:  \u25cf  Use permanent casing on all drilled shafts, unless otherwise stipulated in the Contract.  \u25cf  Ensure that permanent casing is continuously joined.  \u25cf  Advance the permanent surface casing and seat in bedrock.  \u25cf  Stabilize the sidewalls of the shaft by slurry, steel casing, placement and redrilling of concrete  fill,  or  other  means,  as  proposed  and  after  review  and  approval  by  the Engineer.  \u25cf  Use permanent steel casing that complies with ASTM A252, Grade 3 steel.  Ensure that  the  permanent  casing  wall  thickness  is  as  required  to  support  soil  and  water pressures, handling, installation, construction, and transportation loads, but not less than \u215c in.  \u25cf  Ensure that the permanent casing has a minimum diameter as indicated on the Plans.  \u25cf  For vertical and horizontal joints in permanent casings, provide full penetration welds  that conform to AWS Dl.5 requirements.  b.  Temporary  Casing.    When  stipulated  in  the  Contract,  use  casing  to  facilitate  shaft construction and prevent sloughing and caving of the shaft sidewalls.  The Contract may specify  temporary  casing  minimum  elevations.    Place  the  temporary  casing  deeper,  if necessary, to  prevent material  from  entering  the  shaft  excavation.   Use casing  with  an outside diameter no less than the specified diameter of the shaft.  Limit the excavation in advance  of  the  casing  tip  to  no  more  than  10  ft  unless  synthetic  slurry  is  being  used. During  casing  extraction,  maintain  a  sufficient  level  of  fluid  in  the  casing  to  counteract external hydrostatic pressures but no less than 5 ft of positive head.  Maintain an adequate level  of  concrete  within  the  casing  to  ensure  that  fluid  trapped  behind  the  casing  is displaced  upward  and  discharged  at  the  ground  surface  without  contaminating  or displacing  the  shaft  concrete.    Temporary  casings  that  have  become  bound  or  fouled during shaft construction and cannot be removed represent a defect in the drilled shaft. Correct defective shafts using approved methods at no cost to the Department.  Corrective action may include the following:  \u25cf  Removing  the  drilled  shaft  concrete  and  extending  the  drilled  shaft  deeper  to  compensate for the loss of frictional capacity to the cased zone  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS  800-233        Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Providing straddle drilled shafts to compensate for capacity loss  \u25cf  Providing a replacement drilled shaft  Installation Requirements for Crosshole Sonic Logging.  a.  Preparation of Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) Access Tubes.  Install the access tubes as shown on the approved Shop Drawings.  Fasten the tubes at 3-ft intervals to the interior of the reinforcement cage in a parallel manner.  Immediately after concrete placement of the drilled shafts, fill the tubes with clean water and cap the tubes.  Wait a minimum of 24 hours after concrete placement before completing CSL.  Repair or replace (by coring) damaged or blocked tubes.  b.  Tube Criteria.  Install the access tubes in the drilled shafts in a regular, vertical, symmetric  pattern so that four tubes are equally spaced.  c.  Measurement.  Record the spacing between the centerline of adjacent at the third points of the reinforcing cage to an accuracy of 0.25 in.  Provide measurements to the Engineer before placement of the steel reinforcing cage in the shaft.  d.  Access Tubes.  Ensure that the access tubes for Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) are 2 in. ID,  Schedule  40  steel  pipe  conforming  to  ASTM  A53,  Grade  A  or  B,  Type  E,  F,  or  S. Ensure that the access tubes extend the entire length of the shaft to the shaft tip (bottom of drilled shaft/rock socket), and have a round, regular internal diameter free of defects and  obstructions  in  the  tube  and  at  joints  to  permit  free,  unobstructed  passage  of  the source and receiver probes.  Ensure that the tubes are watertight and free from corrosion, with clean internal and external surfaces to ensure good bond between the concrete and tubes.  Construct the tubes with threaded steel caps at top and bottom ends.  Ensure that the tubes are vertical over their entire length.  Provide additional reinforcing/carrier cage to the bottom of the drilled shafts to stabilize and position the access tubes.  e.  Inspection.  Before the placement of the drilled shaft concrete, inspect the CSL tubes to confirm that they are continuous and properly installed.  If they require any remedial work, perform this work before the placement of concrete at no cost to the Department.  f.  Testing.  Ensure that all drilled shafts are CSL tested. Before CSL testing by the Engineer, ensure  that  the  test  probes  can  pass  through  every  tube  to  the  bottom.    If  a  tube  is obstructed, clear the tube by an acceptable means to allow passage of the probe the full length of the tube.  If the tube cannot be cleared, core a hole within the shaft near the obstructed tube that is large enough to accommodate the probe for the full length of the drilled shafts.  Perform all of this at no additional cost to the Department.  Installation of Reinforcing Steel.  a.  Delivery.  If it is not practical to deliver the assembled reinforcing steel to the jobsite as a complete unit ready for installation, make splices on site before lowering the assembly into the hole.  800-234  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS         Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  b.  Cleaning.  Before installation, inspect and clean reinforcing steel of materials that prevent  effective bonding of concrete on steel.  c.  Placement.  Place reinforcing steel in the excavation shaft immediately after cleaning the  bottom.  d.  Reinforcing Steel.  If the shaft cannot be completely concreted within eight hours of the completion of excavation, do not place the reinforcing steel in the excavation.  Recirculate and  reclean  the  slurry  using  airlift  equipment  and  a  desanding  unit  immediately  before placement of the reinforcing steel and concrete.  e.  Centralizers.    Equip  reinforcing  steel  with  non-corrosive,  non-metallic  centralizers  that have sufficient strength to resist any loads they will be subjected to during construction and  to maintain the  specified  minimum  concrete  cover.    Space  centralizers  at  intervals necessary to maintain the specified cover but do not provide a vertical spacing greater than 20 ft.  Do not drop or force reinforcing steel into the shaft.  If the reinforcing steel does not  smoothly  enter  the  excavation,  due  to  misalignment  of  the  reinforcing  cage,  steel casing,  open  borehole,  or  obstructions,  remove  the  cage  and  adjust  and  clean  the excavation as specified until the reinforcing fits smoothly.  f.  Sediment.    After  installation  of  reinforcing  steel  and  immediately  before  concrete placement,  the  Engineer  will  measure  the  bottom  of  the  excavation  to  determine  if sediment has accumulated on the shaft bottom in excess of the requirements.  If excess sediment  is  found  to  have  accumulated  on  the  shaft  bottom,  clean  the  bottom  of  the excavation with equipment that can remove the sediment.  Placing Concrete.  a.  Timing.  Place concrete immediately after inspection and approval by the Engineer of the completed excavation and placement of reinforcement.  If the shaft is not concreted within eight hours after completion of excavation, recirculate and reclean the slurry using airlift equipment and a desanding unit to maintain slurry uniformity throughout the depth of the shaft before placing concrete.  b.  Tremie Pipe Sections.  Ensure that the tremie pipe inside diameter is not less than 10 in. Replace any pipe sections showing signs of wear or defects.  Secure tremie pipe joints with power equipment.  Secure pipe sections with safety chains.  c.  Placement.    Place  concrete  in  one  continuous  operation  through  a  tremie  pipe  directly from the concrete truck or from a concrete pump.  Ensure that no concrete is allowed to free fall when placed.  Use a disposable plug, reviewed and approved by the Engineer, to separate the slurry from the concrete at the top of the tremie pipe.  Ensure that the plug provides continuous separation between the slurry and the concrete for the entire length of the tremie pipe.  Ensure that the bottom of the tremie pipe or the concrete pump pipe is at the bottom of the open borehole before pumping concrete.  If during the placement of concrete, any of the following occur:  \u25cf  There is a sudden drop in concrete level is detected \u25cf  The tremie seal is compromised  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS  800-235      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  The tremie placement is suspended for more than two hours \u25cf  The theoretical volume of concrete deviates more than 10 percent from actual  then, core the shaft at a minimum of four plan locations selected by the Engineer to detect potential  voids,  unacceptable  concrete,  or  other  defects.    Perform  the  coring  and  the remedial actions needed to correct any voids, unacceptable concrete, or other defects.  Additional Requirements for Slurry Displacement Method.  a.  Transport.    Use  equipment  that  produces  a  stable  suspension  and  provides mechanical  agitation.  Transport slurry by means of a temporary pipeline between tank locations and the drilled shafts.  b.  Removal.  Use drilling clean-out buckets and slurry screening equipment that can remove  soil and rock drilling spoil material from the slurry.  c.  Slurry Level.  Maintain the mineral slurry level to a minimum of 3 ft or polymer slurry level to a minimum 3 ft above the groundwater level or surface water level to prevent caving or sloughing of earth.  d.  Slurry Consistency.  Test  the  slurry to verify  satisfactory  characteristics  before  concrete placement  is  started.  Place concrete within the time the excavation remains stable and clean.    Pump  the  displaced  slurry  to  holding  tank(s)  sufficient  to  store  the  entire displaced volume of the drilled shaft.  Do not spill slurry on the site or in the surface water and do not use excavated holding pits.  When no longer needed, properly dispose of slurry at an off-site location.  e.  Concrete Placement.  Place  concrete  through  a  tremie  pipe  directly  from  the  concrete truck or from a concrete pump.  Ensure that the bottom of the tremie pipe or the concrete pump  pipe  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  open  borehole  before  pumping  concrete.    Use  a minimum  10-in. inside diameter tremie pipe.  Do  not  use  aluminum  components.  Clean and smooth the inside and  outside surface of the tremie pipe to permit both the flow  of concrete and the unimpeded withdrawal during concreting.  In addition:  \u25cf  Place  a  spherical  separator  or  other  device  approved  by  the  Engineer  in  the tremie  pipe  immediately  before the  introduction  of  concrete  to  positively  separate the  concrete  from  the  slurry.    The  methods  acceptable  for  review  are  vermiculite plugs,  commercially  available  plastic,  and  rubber  inflatable  or  non-inflatable  plugs. Do not use paper  or  plastic  bags  to separate the slurry and the concrete.  \u25cf  Keep  the  bottom  of  the  tremie  pipe  within  10  in.  of  the  excavation  bottom until the separator floats to the surface of the shaft.  Retrieve the separator plug  from  the excavation, or submit documentation, for the Engineer\u2019s written approval, that the plug material  will  not  cause  a  shaft  defect  if  it remains.  \u25cf  Keep  the  tremie  pipe  embedded  at  least 5  ft  below the top of the  concrete/slurry interface  throughout  the  concrete  placement.  If the tremie pipe is raised above the fluid concrete level, the Engineer will reject the shaft.  800-236  SECTION 845 \u2014 DRILLED SHAFTS      Part 800 \u2014 Bridge Structures  December 2022  \u25cf  Remove and dispose of the upper portion of concrete, contaminated with slurry, that reaches  the  top  of  the  shaft.    The  Engineer  will  observe  the  depth  to  which contaminated  concrete  has  been  removed.  The Engineer will determine if sufficient contaminated  concrete  has  been  removed  or  if  additional  contaminated  concrete requires removal.  Alternative methods of concrete  placement that limit the mixing of slurry  with  concrete  may  be  proposed  for  review  and  approval  by  the  Engineer  in writing.  Acceptance and Rejection of Drilled Shafts.  a.  Acceptance Tests.  The drilled shafts will be accepted for payment only after the CSL tests and the results of concrete tests provide verification of the structural integrity of the drilled shafts,  as  approved  by  the  Engineer  in  writing.    If  the  CSL  record  is  complex  or inconclusive, drill coreholes in the drilled shaft for evaluation of the drilled shaft.  When a defect is confirmed by coring, perform the coring and subsequent grouting of the defect and corehole at no additional cost to the Department.  However, if no defects are found, the Department will pay for the coring costs, including pressure grouting of the coreholes.  b.  Remedial  Action.    If  the  Engineer  determines  that  the  drilled  shafts  are  unacceptable, submit a plan for remedial action to the Engineer for review and approval.  Ensure that calculations  and  working  drawings  for  the  remedial  action  plan  are  stamped  by  a Registered Professional Civil Engineer in the State of Rhode Island.  c.  Final Acceptance.  Following final acceptance of the drilled shafts by the Engineer, tremie  grout the CSL access tubes with a minimum 5000 psi cement grout.  845.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Drilled Shaft \u2013 Furnish and Install in Soil will be measured by the linear foot for the total length in place from the bottom of the permanent casing  to  the  drilled  shaft  cut  off  elevation as accepted by the Engineer.

Perform clearing as necessary to construct the fence to the required grade and alignment.  At locations with small streams or drainage ditches where it is not practical to conform the fence to the general contour of the ground surface, span the opening below the fence with wire fastened to stakes of the length required.  Tie new fence to the terminals of existing fences, and stake down the  chain  link  fence  at  several  points  between  posts.    At  each  location  where  electrical transmission or distribution lines cross any fence type covered by this Specification, furnish and install a ground conforming to Section 9 of the National Electric Safety Code.  Installing Posts.  Set  posts  in  Class  A  concrete  when  the  Contract  requires  that  posts,  braces,  or  anchors  be imbedded in concrete, and install temporary guys or braces as required to support the posts in proper position until the concrete has set sufficiently to anchor the posts.  Do not place materials on posts or place strain on guys and bracing that are set in concrete until directed by the Engineer. Extend concrete footings to the required depth and dimensions.  Where rock is encountered within the required depth to which the post will be erected, drill a hole of a diameter slightly larger than the largest dimension of the post into the rock, and grout the post in.  Place the regular dimensioned concrete footing between the top of the rock and required grade.  Use hollow pipe and tube type post that is fitted with post tops.  Ensure that the bases of the post tops have flanges that fit around the outside of the posts and are secured.  900-10  SECTION 903 \u2014 FENCES  Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  Use tension wires in sections of chain link fence.  Place the top and bottom tension wire, stretched taut and secured at ends, to all posts in a satisfactory manner before fabric is placed.  Installing Fabric.  Place the fabric on the outside of the fence.  Splice the rolls of fabric together.  At end, corner, or gate posts, slip the stretcher bar through the end picket of the fabric and the stretcher bar bands at the same time.  Tighten the bolts in the stretcher bar bands.  Stretch the fence at intervals of 100 ft.  Secure one end of the fabric and apply sufficient tension to remove all slack before making the subsequent attachments.  Tie the fabric to the tension wire with fabric ties spaced not more than 24 in. apart.  Attach the fabric to the line posts with fabric ties spaced not more than 14 in. apart. Place the topmost clip on the line post as near to the top of the fabric as possible and the lowest clip as near to the bottom of the fabric as possible.  At terminal sections (end, corner, and pull) and gate posts, fasten the fabric stretcher bars and bands.  Space the fastenings not more than 14 in. on center for terminal sections (end, corner, and pull) and gate posts.  Place the topmost band on these posts as near to the top of the fabric as possible and the lowest band as near to the bottom as possible.  Before  making  a  closure,  fasten  the  other  end  of  the  run  to  the  end,  corner,  or  gate  post  as described previously.  Use the following for the operation of making a closure of a run.  Clamp the stretching equipment on the ends of the fabric parallel to each other and approximately 5 ft apart when the tension is first applied.  Continue the stretching until the slack has been removed from both sections of the fabric.  If the ends overlap, cut the fabric to match.  Join the ends by the insertion of a picket.  Braces.  When top rail is not used, place braces 12 in. down from the top of the terminal posts and extend from the terminal (end, corner, and pull) post and gate posts to the brace post.  Fasten the braces to the post, and truss the braces from the brace post back to terminal post with round rod and turnbuckle.  Gates.  Place the lower hinge (ball and socket type) on top of the concrete in which the gate post is set. Set the sockets for the cone and foot bolt in concrete so that the plunger pin will fit perfectly in the socket when the gate is in a closed position.  Erect the gates to swing in the direction indicated and provide with gate stops.  Ensure that all hardware is secured, properly adjusted, and left in perfect working order.  Adjust hinges and diagonal bracing in gates so that gates will hang level.  Existing Fence Connection.  Where a new fence joins an existing fence, set the corner post with brace post at the junction and brace  the  corner  posts.    If  the  connection  is  made  at  other  than  the  corner  of  the  new  fence, ensure that the last span of the old fence contains a brace span.

Ensure that the temperature and weather conditions for stone masonry wall construction conform to Subsection 807.03.1.  Mixing of Mortar.  Ensure that the mixing of mortar conforms to Subsection 807.03.2.  Selecting and Storing Stone.  Keep a sufficient stock of the approved stone on site to permit adequate selection and blending of stones by the masons.  Keep the stones free from dirt, oil, or any other injurious material that may prevent the proper adhesion of the mortar or detract from the appearance of the exposed surfaces.  Shaping and Dressing Stones.  Use selected stone, roughly squared and pitched to line, at all angles and wall ends.  Perform all shaping and dressing of stone before the stone is laid in the wall.  Do not use any dressing or hammering that will loosen the stone after it is placed.  If a stone is loosened after the mortar is set, remove the stone, clean the mortar, and relay the stone in fresh mortar.  Laying Stone.  Lay the wall compactly with all vertical joints in the interior of the wall completely filled with suitable stones or spalls thoroughly bedded in mortar.  Clean and wet each stone to be set in mortar before being  set  in  a  full  bed  of  fresh  mortar.    Ensure  that  the  stones  are  settled  in  place  before  the mortar has set.  Remove any mortar in which initial set has commenced from the mixing boards or receptacles; do not reuse the mortar in the work.  Do not retemper any mortar.  When laying is interrupted, leave the top courses unplastered.  900-34  SECTION 911 \u2014 STONE MASONRY WALLS  Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  Lay the masonry to line and in the required pattern.  Lay the stone with bearing beds parallel to the  natural  bed  of the  material.   Restrict the  use  of  chinking  stones  in  the  face to  a  minimum, which will be permitted only in the horizontal joints to provide firm bearing of stones.  Do not chink vertical joints in the face.  Prevent the bunching of small stones or stones of similar size.  When weathered or colored stones, or stones of varying textures are being used, distribute the various kinds of stones uniformly throughout the exposed faces of the work.  Ensure that the foundation (base) of the wall is composed of large stones (stones that are distinctly larger than the majority of the stones in the wall) that are laid to form a relatively flat surface upon which the succeeding courses may be placed.  Use large stones for the bottom courses and, in general, decrease these stones in size from the bottom to the top of the work.  Ensure that at least one-fourth of the stones in the face are headers (a stone laid with its end toward the face of the wall) and evenly distribute these stones.  Extend headers not less than 12 in. into the core (or the stones that make up the center) of the wall.  Ensure that headers are uniform  in  height  and  width  throughout  their  length.    Extend  headers  in  walls  2  ft  or  less  in thickness entirely through the wall.  Lay all stones to break joints and to thoroughly bond the work.  Place stones to form bonds with the stones of adjoining courses of not less than 12 in. ashlar (squared and dressed stone) and split face masonry and not less than 6 in. rubble masonry.  Place headers over stretchers (stones laid with their length parallel to the face of the wall) and, in general, ensure that the headers of each course equally divide the spaces between the headers of adjoining courses.  Do not place any header over a joint and do not make any joint over a header.  Place headers in each course, which must have a width of not less than 1\u00bd times their thickness and must be spaced no further than 8 ft apart, center to center.  Ensure that stretchers have a length of bed not less than 2 times nor more than 3\u00bd times their thickness and not less than 3 ft.  Finish the tops of walls flat.

This provision ensures adequate and fair compensation for unpredictable and fluctuating costs that, from time to time, occur in the prices of liquid asphalt, diesel fuel, and steel, as described below.  938.02  DEFINITIONS.  Base Price of Liquid Asphalt and Diesel Fuel.  The base price is the unit price of the material (FOB Terminal) as determined by the Department. The base prices for liquid asphalt and diesel fuel will be determined just before the first date that the NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS is advertised in the public press.  Period Price of Liquid Asphalt and Diesel Fuel.  The  period  prices  for  liquid  asphalt  and  diesel  fuel  (FOB  Terminal)  will  be  determined  for  any one-month period following the NOTICE TO PROCEED during which the price varies from the base price.  Base Price (BP) for Steel.  The base price for steel will be determined by the Department just before the first date that the NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS is advertised in the public press.  Period Price Index (PPI) for Steel.  For all steel items, the PPI will be defined as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index  (PPI)  for  \u201cSteel  Mill  Products,\u201d  Series  ID  WPU  1017-02  (not  seasonally  adjusted).    The latest version of the index will be used, including any corrections or rebasing of the index.

For all steel items, the Base Price Index (BPI) will be defined as the BLS PPI just before the first date that the NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS is advertised in the public press.  Period Price (PP) for Steel.  The period price for steel will be calculated as follows: PP = (BP \u00d7 (PPI/BPI)).  SECTION 938 \u2014 PRICE ADJUSTMENTS  900-107             Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  938.03  PRICE ADJUSTMENT.  Price adjustments for liquid asphalt and diesel fuel will be determined by the difference between the period price and the base price.  Price adjustments for liquid asphalt and diesel fuel will be made at the end of each month during which a) work was accomplished on the Project, and b) prices varied.  Price adjustments for steel will be calculated every month that steel is purchased, but only applied when steel price indices vary by more than 5.0 percent.  Price adjustments for work performed after the Contract completion date, including approved time extension(s), will be as follows:  Credit due the Contractor will be the lesser amount calculated from the following two algorithms (a and b), whereas credit due the Department will be the greater of the two calculations:  a.  Actual Monthly Period Prices.  The price adjustment calculated using the actual monthly  period prices in effect at the time of the construction.  b.  Monthly Period Prices in Effect.  The price adjustment calculated using the monthly period prices in effect during a period determined by setting the last day of relevant work to the Contract completion date as may have been modified by approved time extension(s).  Price adjustments due the Contractor will be made according to an approved Contract Addendum. Credit due the Department will be processed by deducting monies from progress payments or by other means if there are insufficient progress payments remaining.  Asphalt Binder.  The asphalt content will be the optimum amount used in every ton of asphalt concrete mixture, as  determined  by  the  Department\u2019s  Materials  Engineer,  using  the  method  for  determination  of optimum binder content as set forth in SECTION M03.  The price adjustment will be determined by multiplying the total weight of asphalt binder, in tons, by the difference between the base price and period price.  The base price of asphalt binder is set forth in Special Provision Code 938.1000.  Diesel Fuel.  The fuel for operating the plant and the fuel for hauling and placing asphalt concrete will equal the  total  number  of  tons  of  asphalt  concrete  placed  during  the  month  in  question  times  a  fuel adjustment  factor  of  2.5  gal  of  fuel  per  ton  of  asphalt  concrete.    Tonnage  of  asphalt  concrete placed  during  the  month  in  question  will  equal  the  sum  of  the  weights  indicated  on  the  Daily Automated Recordation printout slips provided at the plant.  The price adjustment will be determined by multiplying the total volume of fuel, in gallons, by the difference between the base price and the period price.  The base price of diesel fuel is set forth in Special Provision Code 938.1000.  900-108  SECTION 938 \u2014 PRICE ADJUSTMENTS       Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  Steel.  Steel price adjustments will apply only when specified in the Contract and only to unfabricated structural  steel  material,  consisting  of  rolled  shapes,  plate  steel,  sheet  piling,  pipe  piles,  steel castings, steel forgings, and unfabricated reinforcing steel bars.  Payments will only be made for fluctuations in the cost of the steel material used in the items specified.  Steel price adjustments will not be made to steel purchased before the time of bid opening for conventional contracting methods (design/bid/build) or submittal of price proposals for all other contracting methods.  Steel  price  adjustments  will  not  include  the  costs  of  Shop  Drawing  preparation,  handling, fabrication,  welding,  erection,  surface  preparation,  coatings,  transportation,  storage,  staging, installation, profit, overhead, fuel costs, fuel surcharges, or other charges not related to the cost of the unfabricated structural steel and unfabricated reinforcing steel.  The  weight  of  steel  subject  to  a  price  adjustment  will  be  calculated  based  on  approved  Shop Drawings and incorporated into the final Work.  For  all  steel  items  specified  above,  the  price  adjustment  will  be  determined  according  to thresholds as follows:  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  If the absolute value of [(PP-BP)/BP] is less than or equal to a threshold of 0.050, then no price adjustment is made.  If  the  absolute  value  of  [(PP-BP)/BP]  is  greater  than  0.050,  then  a  price  adjustment  is made and will apply to the full variance between the base price and the period price.  If the threshold is exceeded and the PP is higher than the BP, the price adjustment owed to the Contractor is calculated as follows:  [PP \u2013 BP] \u00d7 Weight of steel  If the threshold is exceeded and the PP is lower than the BP, the price adjustment owed to the Department is calculated as follows:  [BP \u2013 PP] \u00d7 Weight of steel  The base price of steel is set forth in Special Provision Code 938.1000.  938.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.

SECTION 938 \u2014 PRICE ADJUSTMENTS  900-109        Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  \u2014 STONE WALLS IN HISTORIC, SCENIC, OR RURAL AREAS  939.01  DESCRIPTION.  This work includes the resetting and construction of stone walls in historic, scenic, or rural areas at the required locations.  939.02  MATERIALS.  Stones.  Stones for walls to be reset include stones in the existing wall, with additional stones as required to  complete  the  wall  construction.    Ensure  that  additional  stones  conform  to  the  stones  in  the existing wall relative to shape, color, texture, and geological composition.  Ensure that stones for new walls conform to stones found in nearby walls relative to the aforementioned characteristics.  Stones used below grade, for the core, or for the back of a retaining wall need not meet these criteria.  However, use stones that conform to SECTION M14 and that are appropriately sized and shaped to permit proper interlocking with the existing stones.  Retain any special features such as lintels, gate posts, copings, markers, etc., for resetting.  Mortar.  Use mortar that conforms to Subsection M04.03.5.  939.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  General Requirements.  Ensure that the laying of stones conforms to Subsections 911.03 and 912.03.  For the construction of walls in historic areas, use stone masons with demonstrated proficiency in  historic  stone  masonry  construction/restoration  practices.    Submit  documentation  to  the Engineer of professional certifications and the locations of at least three successfully completed stone walls similar in type to the work to be performed no less than 30 days before the start of work.    This  documentation  must  be  approved  by  the  Engineer  in  consultation  with  the  RIDOT Historic  Preservation  Specialist  for  the  masonry  contractor  to  be  allowed  to  perform  the  work. Ensure  that the  approved  mason(s)  complete  the  entire  work  item for  which  the  approval  was given.  Documentation.  Before dismantling historically significant walls, measure and record their width and height at 25-ft intervals and at locations where characteristics of the wall change.  Take a minimum of six digital color photographs of each wall to be dismantled in locations that are representative of the walls original type.  If no representative wall sections exist, the Engineer in consultation with the RIDOT Historic Preservation Specialist will determine the finished appearance/dimensions.  Submit two copies of the measurements and two sets of photographs to the Engineer.  This documentation must  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Engineer  in  consultation  with  the  RIDOT  Historic  900-110  SECTION 939 \u2014 STONE WALLS IN HISTORIC, SCENIC, OR RURAL AREAS         Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  Preservation Specialist for accuracy before the walls are dismantled.  Once approved, this record of the walls will be referenced during the reconstruction of the walls and will remain the property of the Department.  Dismantling.  Carefully dismantle historically significant walls to be removed and reset to avoid fracturing and chipping the stones.  Stockpile the stones in the area where the wall will be rebuilt.  If the stones must  be  temporarily  moved  to  a  different  location,  keep  the  stones  separate  from  any  other stones.    Do  not  use  a  dump  truck  to  transport  stone  from  historically  significant  walls.    The Contractor  will  be  responsible  for  protecting  all  stockpiled  stones  from  damage,  theft,  and vandalism.  Resetting.  Ensure  that  exposed  face(s)  consist  of  stones  from  the  extant  walls.    During  resetting,  keep weathered stone faces exposed.  Blend additional stones required to complete the walls with the existing stone to reduce any incompatibility in the appearance of the walls.  Duplicate the original wall and any special features such as lintels, gateposts, openings, copings, markers, etc.  New Walls.  When new stone walls are required in the vicinity of historic properties and districts, construct a 5-ft  long  sample  section  of  wall.    The  Engineer  in  consultation  with  the  RIDOT  Historic Preservation  Specialist  will  approve  the  stone,  joint  construction,  and  overall  character  of installation of the sample section.  The approved sample section may be part of the finished work. Demolish and rebuild any rejected sample section.  Weep Holes.  Use weep holes constructed of solid, gray PVC pipe that includes the resetting and construction of stone walls in historic, scenic, or rural areas.  These walls require special treatment as indicated herein.  Cleaning.  Remove all excess material and leave the site in a presentable condition.  If surplus stones exist, the  Engineer  will  determine  whether  to  transport  the  surplus  stones  to  an  offsite,  permanent stockpile area or to dispose of the material.  939.04  METHOD OF MEASUREMENT.  Stone Walls in Historic, Scenic, or Rural Areas will be measured by the number of cubic yards of masonry placed.

Refer  to  veterans  and/or  individuals  currently  participating  of  any  government  assistance program, for low-income individuals, administered by the RI Department of Human Services.  As part of the contractor's equal employment opportunity and affirmative action programs, training shall be provided as follows:  \u2022 The contractor shall provide on-the-job training aimed at developing full journey worker  status in the type of trade or job classification involved.  \u2022 The number of training hours assigned to this contract per this TSP will be xxx hours.  The  number of trainees to be trained under this TSP will be  trainees.  \u2022  In  the  event  that  a  contractor  subcontracts  a  portion  of  the  contract  work,  he/she  shall determine  how  many,  if  any,  of  the  trainees  are  to  be  trained  by  the  subcontractor, provided, however, that the contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements of this TSP.  The contractor shall also ensure that this TSP is made  applicable  to  such  subcontract.    Where  feasible,  25  percent  of  apprentices  or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training.  \u2022 The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of the contractor's needs and the availability of journey workers in the various classifications within  a  reasonable  area  of  recruitment.    Prior  to  commencing  construction,  at  the preconstruction meeting, the contractor shall submit to RIDOT for approval a Contractor Training Proposal (TR1 form) stating the number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and training program to be used.  Furthermore, the contractor shall specify the anticipated starting time for training in each of the classifications.  The contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by him/her on the contract work that is currently enrolled  or  becomes  enrolled  in  an  approved  program  and  will  be  reimbursed  for  such trainees  as  provided  hereinafter.    All  trainees,  participating  in  the  On-the-Job-Training (OJT) program, must be registered (TR2 form) with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) and approved prior to starting work onsite.  Unregistered trainees will not be eligible for training credit and/or training reimbursement.  943.02  GOOD FAITH EFFORTS.  Make  every  effort  to  enroll  minority,  women,  and  disadvantaged  trainees  (e.g.,  by  conducting systematic  and  direct  recruitment  through  public  and  private  sources  likely  to  yield  minority, women  and  disadvantaged  trainees)  to  the  extent  that  such  persons  are  available  within  a reasonable  area  of  recruitment.   Furnish  evidence  of  his/her  systematic and  direct  recruitment efforts  to  the  satisfaction  of  RIDOT  prior  to  a  determination  as  to  whether  a  contractor  is  in compliance  with  the  contract\u2019s  TSP.    These  efforts  are  required  regardless  of  whether  the contractor is union or non-union.  A contractor is not considered to have met this OJT requirement if  he/she  selects  job  classifications  in  the  unskilled  or  semi-skilled  positions  (e.g.,  flaggers, laborers).  This training commitment is not intended, and shall not be used, to discriminate against any applicant for training, whether a member of a minority group or not.  Nonetheless, provide to the Office of Civil Rights all documented Good Faith Efforts (GFEs) prior to hiring outside the OJT program\u2019s primary objective.  SECTION 943 \u2015 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING  900-121  Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classification in which he/she has successfully completed  a  training  course  leading  to  journey  worker  status,  or  in  which  he/she  has  been employed  as  a  journey  worker.    The  contractor  may  satisfy  this  requirement  by  including appropriate questions in the employee application, or by other suitable means.  Regardless of the method used, the contractor's records shall document the findings in each case.  943.03  ACCEPTABLE TRAINING.  The  minimum  length  and  type  of  training  for  each  classification  shall  be  as  established  in  the training program selected by the contractor and approved by RIDOT and the Federal Highway Administration.   RIDOT and the  Federal  Highway  Administration  will  approve  a  program  if  it  is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor and to qualify the trainee(s) for journey worker status in the classification concerned by the end of the training  period.   Furthermore,  apprenticeship  programs registered  with  the  U.S.  Department  of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with the Rhode Island apprenticeship agency recognized by the Bureau, and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Manpower  Administration,  and  Bureau  of  Apprenticeship  are acceptable for the purposes of this TSP.  Training will be considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federal-aid highway construction contracts.  Approval or acceptance of a training program shall be obtained from RIDOT prior to commencing work on the  classification  covered  by  the  program.    It  is  the  intention  of  this  TSP  that  training  is  to  be provided in the construction crafts rather than clerk-typists or secretarial-type positions.  Training in the laborer classification may be permitted provided that significant and meaningful training is provided and is approved by the division office of the FHWA.  Training at other RIDOT Projects is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program.  Submit the  training  verification  (TR3  form)  from  all  RIDOT  Projects  to  OCR  once  a  month  with corresponding Monthly OJT Training reports (TR5 form).  Forms listed below.  943.04  OJT TRAINING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  NOTE:   RIDOT reserves the right to revise and/or rename the reporting process and forms that it  requires  contractors  to  submit  to  enable  RIDOT  to  monitor  OJT  compliance. Contractors agree to follow the process and use the forms that RIDOT requires.  (TR0 Form) On-the-Job-Training (OJT) Acknowledgment and Statement of Intent Compliance  (TR1 Form) Contractor Training Proposal  (TR2 Form) New Trainee Registration (TR3 Form) Trainee Weekly Verification  (TR5 Form) Monthly OJT Hours Report (TR6 Form) Trainee Status Change  (TR7 Form) Certificate of Training  (TR9 Form) Training Goal Reconsideration Request  Forms available to print at http://www.dot.ri.gov/about/who/civil_rights.php.  900-122  SECTION 943 \u2015 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING  Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  943.05  TRAINEES.  RIDOT\u2019s On-the-Job-Training program is a hybrid of both Project-Specific and Contractor-Based FHWA programs.  Project-Specific.  OJT goals are assigned to specific federal-aid contracts.  Goals are to be met by the project\u2019s substantial completion date.  Ensure that trainees are enrolled under the specific project to meet its contract\u2019s TSP requirement.  All training hours attained by the trainee will be applied toward the project\u2019s OJT goal.  Contractor-Based.  Registered  and  approved  OJT  trainees  are  permitted  to  work  among  multiple  RIDOT  projects when necessary.  However, all worked training hours will be applied toward meeting the specific project\u2019s OJT goal in which the trainee was enrolled.  943.06  REIMBURSEMENT.  Except as otherwise noted below, the contractor will be reimbursed at a rate of $6.00 per hour of onsite training provided to each trainee in accordance with an approved training program.  This reimbursement will be made even if the contractor receives additional training program funds from other  sources,  provided  such  other  does  not  specifically  prohibit  the  contractor  from  receiving other reimbursement.  Therefore, it is contractors\u2019 responsibility to determine if it is permissible to accept training reimbursement concurrently from other sources.  Reimbursement for offsite training will not be made to the Contractor.  No  reimbursement  under  this  TSP  will  be  made  to  the  contractor  if  the  failure  to  provide  the required training, is caused by the contractor and evidences a lack of good faith on the part of the contractor in meeting the requirements of this TSP.  Training Invoices must be submitted to the Resident Engineer (RE) along with proof of OJT compliance (e.g., copy of the Certificate of OJT Goal  Attainment  (COA1),  approved  TR5s  etc.).    Contractors  that  failed  to  comply  with  the contract\u2019s TSP requirements will be required to contact OCR to request an OJT Good Faith Efforts Assessment (TR12 form) in order to obtain an OJT compliance determination.  Contractors with a satisfactory compliance determination will be eligible for training reimbursement.  Contractors with  an  unsatisfactory  compliance  determination  will  not  be  eligible  for  training  reimbursement and may be subject to sanctions (please refer to the noncompliance procedures and sanctions section below for details).  It is normally expected that a trainee will begin training on the project as soon as feasible after start  of  work,  utilizing  the  skill(s)  involved,  and  remain  on  the  project  as  long  as  training opportunities  exist  in  the  work  classification  or  until  the  trainee  has  completed  the  training program.    It  is  not  required  that  all  trainees  be  employed  as  such  for  the  entire  length  of  the contract.    A  contractor  will  have  fulfilled  his/her  responsibilities  under  this  TSP  if  he/she  has provided  acceptable  training  and  number  of  training  hours  to  the  number  of  trainees  specified therein.  The number trained shall be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled on the contract for a significant period.  SECTION 943 \u2015 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING  900-123  Part 900 \u2014 Incidental Construction and Services  December 2022  Trainees  will  be  paid  the  appropriate  rates  approved  by  the  Departments  of  Labor  or Transportation.  Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate minimum journeyman's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period, 75 percent for the third quarter of the training period, and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period, unless apprentices or trainees from  an  approved  existing  program  (e.g.,  unions\u2019  apprenticeship  programs)  are  enrolled  as trainees on this project.  In that case, the appropriate rates approved by the Departments of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification covered by this TSP.  The contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program he/she will follow in providing the training.  The contractor shall provide each trainee with a certification showing the type and length of training satisfactorily completed.  The  contractor  will  provide  for  the  maintenance  of  records  and  furnish  periodic  reports documenting his/her performance under this TSP.  943.07  TRAINING GOAL RECONSIDERATION REQUEST.  Contractors that have evidence of implemented Good Faith Efforts (GFE), exerted to comply with the contract\u2019s TSP requirements, and that are having difficulty meeting the contract\u2019s OJT goal may submit a Training Goal Reconsideration Request (TR9 Form) requesting OCR to reassess the contract\u2019s OJT goal considering the provided GFE.  The form must be submitted at least 30 days before the project\u2019s substantial completion date but not after the project\u2019s employment peak season.  Documented GFE must accompany the TR9 form including a letter justifying the request.

This  work  includes  illuminating  work  zone  and  lane  drop  areas  and  all  other  areas  with channelization devices placed along the roadway to direct or restrict traffic, as required for night work operations.  Illumination of these areas will be provided by both floodlighting and equipment- mounted lighting.  Refer to Section 6F82 of the currently adopted MUTCD.  944.02  MATERIALS.  Floodlights.  For all floodlights for both the lane drop areas and the equipment mounted lighting, use cut-off type  light  distribution  that  has  a  die-cast  aluminum  housing  with  integrally-case  heavy-duty hinges.  Close the fixture housing door with two or more captive screws.  Ensure that the door has positive gasketing to ensure water tightness and dust tightness.  Do not provide weep holes to the housing.  Use a reflector that has high purity anodized aluminum with a secondary internal reflector element to reflect high angle rays back into the beam to achieve high beam utilization.  944.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Plan of Operation.  Before  proceeding  with  any  night  work,  submit  a  plan  for  night  work  operations,  including  the placement of illumination devices, to the Engineer for review and approval.  Ensure that the Plan includes permanent lighting at the applicable locations (e.g., shifts, splits, other area designated by the Engineer).  Illumination Standards.  Maintain the following standards at all times during night operations.  For lane drops, illuminate the traveled way within the lane drop areas and all cones, barrels, or other  physical  barriers  placed  on  the  roadway  for  the  purpose  of  channelizing  or  restricting vehicular traffic to a minimum average of 2 ft candles measured on both the horizontal and vertical planes  6  in.  above  the  surface  in  question.    Locate  all  portable  lighting  off  the  traveled  way opposite  the  channelizing  devices  (i.e.,  when  closing  the  left  or  high-speed  lanes,  all  lighting should be placed on the right side of roadway).  Aim all lighting to avoid shadows on the traveled way and prevent excessive glare to the motorist.  Accomplish the illumination of the lane drop areas using 250-watt, 400-watt, 1000-watt metal halide floodlights.  Mount floodlights on portable or fixed poles, tripods or staging in a location off the traveled way.  Rope off the lighting staging area to all personnel except the lighting technicians.  Power Sources.  Provide portable generators of the type, size, and wattage output required to adequately energize the lighting equipment specified.  Ensure that the generator placement and wiring comply with all applicable electrical codes and pertinent OSHA safety standards.  Ensure that the lighting fixture and generator electrical rating are compatible.

Where there is existing or new  plant  material,  ensure  that  no  lime,  fertilizer,  mulch,  and/or  seed  mix  contacts  the  plant material or their mulched areas.  Preparation of Areas for Seeding.  a.  Type 1 (General Highway Seeding).  Rake Type 1 areas either by hand or mechanically (e.g., power rake) to produce a loose, friable seed bed.  Use a dozer to track slopes 3H:1V and steeper.  Ensure that the resulting track imprints are perpendicular to the flow of water.  Remove and dispose of all sticks, litter, wire, weeds, cable, cobbles, or stones larger than 1 in. for any dimension.  Where the seed bed has become compacted, scarify to a depth of 5 in. before raking.  Do not use seeding of this type where the seed bed has not been properly prepared or where the soil is compacted.  b.  Type 2 (Residential Seeding).  Hand rake Type 2 areas to a finished grade.  Remove and dispose of all sticks, litter, wire, weeds, cable, cobbles, and stones larger than \u00bd-in. in any dimension.    After  hand  raking,  roll  the  entire  area.    Blend  the  finished  grade  of  the proposed area into the adjacent lawns (where applicable).  Where the seed bed has become compacted, scarify to a depth of 5 in. before fine raking. Do not use seeding where the seed bed has not been properly prepared or where the soil is compacted.  c.  Type  3  (Temporary  Seeding).    Ensure  that  Type  3  areas  to  be  seeded  are  free  of  depressions and unprotected channels where runoff may cause erosion.  d.  Type 4 (Native Grass Seeding).  Prepare Type 4 areas according to Para. a.  e.  Type 5 (Wetland Seeding).  Do not rake Type 5.  Remove and dispose of all sticks, litter, wire,  weeds,  cable,  cobbles,  or  stones  larger  than  4  in.  for  any  dimension  without disturbing the finished grade.  f.  Type  6  (Wildflower  Seeding).    Prepare  Type  6  areas  according  to  Para.  A.  except  as  designated below.  For Type 6 areas previously seeded or containing existing vegetation, remove all sod from the site proposed for wildflower seeding.  Apply plantable soil to raise the planting bed to final grade after sod removal.  Rake the areas to produce a loose friable soil.  Application of Lime.  Apply lime (ground or pelletized) dry and spread evenly over the entire surface to be seeded.  Use an application rate of 1 ton per acre.  Complete the raking after the lime and fertilizer have been applied.  DO NOT APPLY LIME ON TYPE 3, TYPE 4, AND TYPE 5 AREAS.  L-4  SECTION L02 \u2014 SEEDING        Part L \u2014 Landscaping  December 2022  Application of Fertilizer.  After the application of lime, spread the fertilizer at the following rates:  \u2022 Types 1 and 2 \u2015  850 lb per acre \u2022 Type 3 \u2015  650 lb per acre \u2022 Type 4 \u2015 500 lb per acre \u2022 Type 5 \u2015  Do not apply fertilizer \u2022 Type 6 \u2015  150 lb per acre  Incorporate both the lime and fertilizer into the soil by raking according to Subsection L02.03.2.

Type  2  (Residential  Seeding).    Seed  Type  2  areas  with  a  Residential  Seed  Mix.    Use additional  hand  raking  and  rolling  in  lieu  of  mulch.    The  Engineer  will  not  accept  these areas until a generally weed-free, 3-in. stand of grass is established.  c. Type 3 (Temporary Seeding).  Seed Type 3 areas with a Temporary Seed Mix on flats  and slopes.  Both mechanical and hydroseeding methods may be used.  d. Type  4  (Native  Grass  Seeding).    Seed  Type  4  areas  with  a  Native  Seed  Mix.    Both  mechanical and hydroseeding methods may be used.  e. Type 5 (Wetland Seeding).  Seed Type 5 areas with a Wetland Seed Mix.  Where there is access for a hydroseeder, spread the Wetland Seed Mix using this method only.  Where there  is  no  access  for  a  hydroseeder,  spread  the  wetland  seed  mix  by  a  hand-held spreader.  f. Type 6 (Wildflower Seeding).  Seed Type 6 areas with a Wildflower Seed Mix.  Seeds may be mechanically applied by overseeding the area with a slit seeder or broadcast with the use of a drop or broadcast spreader.  A hydroseeder may be used.  When a hydroseeding method is used, use the seed, fertilizer, and 10 percent of the mulch in the first application and the remaining 90 percent of mulch in a second application.  If a slit seeder is used, disburse the seed 3 in. on center and \u00bc-in. deep.  Make two passes, the second perpendicular to the first.  Disburse small seeds separately from larger seeds.  If  a  drop  or  broadcast  seeding  method  is  used,  spread  the  large  seed  separately  from small  seeds.    Disburse  each  seed  type  (large  or  small)  in  two  passes,  the  second perpendicular to the first.  Hand rake the area to provide a soil coverage of a \u00bc in.  SECTION L02 \u2014 SEEDING  L-5  Part L \u2014 Landscaping  December 2022  Mulching.  Cover all seeded areas with a suitable mulch at the time of seed application.  Use cellulose fiber mulch that conforms to Subsection M18.08.1.  Use  cellulose  fiber  mulch  separately  or  as  part  of  a  hydroseeding  operation.    If  cellulose  fiber mulch is applied separately, apply the mulch immediately after the seeding operation.  Remove cellulose fiber mulch that becomes adhered to signs, sign posts, lighting standards, new or existing plant materials, and/or walls.  Care During Construction.  Reseed any areas that fail to show a uniform growth of grass until the areas are covered with a satisfactory growth of grass as approved by the Engineer.  For the seed, fertilizer, etc., used in reseeding operations, use the required application rates and required seeding dates as previously specified.  a. Watering.  Water Type 1, Type 2, Type 4, and Type 6 seeded areas within 72 hours of the  seeding operation.  One additional watering may be required.  Apply water at a controlled rate and ensure that the water reaches the root zone.  Do not allow  watering  operations  to  flood  adjacent  areas,  erode  soil,  or  cause  damage  to  the seeded areas.  b. Mowing.  Accomplish the mowing for Type 1 seeded areas in two mowings per year on areas flatter than 3H:1V.  Perform mowing on Type 2 seeded areas when the grass has obtained a height of 4 in. and then maintain at a 4-in. height until accepted.  Only mow Type 1 and Type 2 seeded areas.  Ensure that each cutting results in a stand of evenly mowed grass, 3 in. tall immediately following the cutting.  Perform neat trimming around all poles, trees, ledges, delineators, curbs, piers, abutments, and other structures falling within the seeded areas, which will be conducted  simultaneously  with  the  mowing  during  each  cutting  operation.    Trim  and expose all curbs; ensure that all gutters are free of grass clippings.  c. Failure  to  Perform  Care During  Construction.

Ensure that seals are  conditioned  through  six  complete  cycles  of  compression  and  that  all  readings  are taken on the seventh cycle.  At 20 percent compression of the nominal width, ensure that seals 1.25 in. or less exert a stress of not less than 1.5 pounds per linear inch per inch of height of seal and have a safe compressibility of 40 percent or less of the nominal width.  Ensure that seals of nominal width greater than 1.25 in. exert a stress of not less than 2 pounds per linear inch per inch of height of seal at 20 percent compression and have a safe  compressibility  of  50  percent  or  less  of  the  nominal  width.    The  maximum  safe compressibility  is  that  point  in  compression  where  the  air  voids  are  closed  and  the elastometer itself is in compression.  Ensure that the maximum safe compressibility does not exceed 100 pounds per linear inch per inch of height of seal at the above stated safe compressibility levels.  Use the compression-deflection characteristic of the seal to classify the seal according to movements of 0.05 in., 1.0 in., 1.5 in., and 2.0 in.  No tolerance on movement classification shall be permitted.  Ensure that the movement of the seal as determined above does not exceed or be equal to its classification.

Scheduling Detector Installations and Restoration.  When a new roadway or driveway is installed and detector installations are stipulated, ensure that the detection is installed and operational before opening the roadway or driveway to traffic.  When the Contractor mills and overlays or otherwise resurfaces an existing roadway that will be open  to  traffic,  and  these  operations  damage  existing  detection  thereby  rendering  it  non- functional, restore properly operating detection within seven calendar days.  When the existing detection  is rendered  non-functional  by  the  Contractor\u2019s  operations, restore  properly  operating detection within 72 hours.  Inductance Loop Detector Installation.  Complete handholes, conduits, and curb cuts before beginning the loop installation.  Outline the loop on the pavement to conform to the specified configuration.  SECTION T13  \u2014 DETECTION, PREEMPTION, AND PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEM  T-39          Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  Cut a slot in the pavement of sufficient width (min. \u215c in.) to allow placement of loop wire (single or twisted pair) into the saw cut and with a depth that will place the last loop turn between 1\u00bd in. and 2\u00bd in. below the final surface.  Smooth any sharp edges in the corners.  Overlap the inter- section of saw cuts so that the slots have full depth and a smooth bottom.  Immediately after sawing, clean the slot and pavement with high pressure clean water to remove the saw slurry.  Use filtered compressed air to remove all dust and moisture from the slot.  Do not proceed with the installation until the slot is dry.  Hot air may be used to dry the saw slot.  To protect the loop wire at the edge of the pavement or curb, install a 1-in. minimum diameter flexible PVC or vinyl conduit(s) between the pavement and handhole.  Install the loop wire starting at the roadside handhole, around the loop for the specified number of turns, and back to the handhole.  Do not allow splices outside the handhole.  Depress the wire in the slot without the use of sharp objects that might damage the wire insulation.  Hold the loop in place every 2 ft with 2-in. (approximate) strips of open-celled polyurethane backer rod.  Leave the hold down strips in place when the slot is filled with roadway loop embedding sealer.  Where the loop wire crosses pavement joints and cracks, protect the loop wires as required.  Apply a waterproof seal to the ends of the vinyl or PVC tubing encasing the wire immediately after placing  the  wire  to  prevent  moisture  from  entering  the  tube.    Ensure  that  the  tubing  has  a continuous length from the curb to the handhole.  Twist together the pair of loop wires between the edge of the loop and the splice to the shielded lead-in cable in the handhole 3 to 5 turns per ft.  Ensure  that  the  splice  between  the  loop  wires  (twisted  pair)  and  the  shielded  lead-in  cable  is moisture proof and has a dielectric strength at least equal to that of the original insulation.  Ensure that there is no moisture in the splice during the operation and that the work is performed in dry weather or under shelter.  Ensure that all parts of the splice and tools involved are clean and dry.  Stagger individual splices in each wire to minimize the outside diameter of the finished splice.  Twist and solder the bared conductor ends, and reinsulate using an electrical grade fast drying sealant and plastic polyvinyl chloride tape.  Extend the reinsulation approximately 1 in. onto the adjacent insulation at each end.  Apply sufficient layers so that the thickness is one and one- half times that of the original insulation.  Ensure reinsulation of the outer jacket similarly, except extend the reinsulation approximately 4 in. onto the adjacent jacket at each end.  Continue the shielded lead-in cable (no splices) from the splices to the loop wires to the controller cabinet terminals only.  Ensure that the completed loop installation, including the shielded lead-in to the controller cabinet, has  a  minimum  of  100 megohms  leakage  resistance  to  ground.   Test  this  resistance  after the splice is made between the loop wires (twisted pair) and shielded lead-in.  In  addition  to  measuring  the  leakage  to  ground,  use  test  instruments  capable  of  measuring electrical values of the installed loop wires and lead-ins, measure induced AC voltage, inductance in  microhenries,  high  \u201cQ\u201d  indication,  and  the  resistance  of  the  conductors  in  ohms.    Upon  T-40  SECTION T13  \u2014 DETECTION, PREEMPTION, AND PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEM     Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  measuring the loops, report to the Engineer any unusual readings or readings not in agreement with the calculated values.  Testing of the loop may occur during or after the installation of the loop.  When a loop does not meet calculated values, install a new loop in its place.  Ensure that the pavement temperatures are 40\u00b0F minimum and rising before the sealer is placed. Perform all work involving the sealer according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.  When the loop  embedding  sealer  has  set  sufficiently  to  open  the  loop  to  traffic,  but  the  surface  remains tacky, the loop may be dusted with cement to facilitate opening the loop to traffic.  Pedestrian Detector Installation.  Install  pedestrian  pushbuttons  according  to  Subsection  T10.03.    Mount  all  pushbuttons, regardless of mounting type, at a height of 3 ft 6 in.  Take the measurement from the center of the  pushbuttons  to  the  finished  sidewalk  elevation.    Ensure  that  the  maximum  reach  to  the pushbutton is 10 in. from the finished, level, ADA-compliant surface.  Ensure that all pedestrian pushbutton detector housings are Federal Yellow in color, unless the Contract calls for other signal equipment within the same intersection to be a different color.  In the  latter  case,  match  the  color  of  the  pushbutton  detector  housing  to  that  of  the  other  signal equipment.  Test  each  accessible  pedestrian  detector  in  the  field  after  initial  installation  according  to  the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and with the Engineer present, plus other representatives when so  designated  by  the  Contract.

Use  a  composition,  binder,  pigments,  thermoplastic  compound  pavement  marking  material, reflective glass spheres, and epoxy resin marking material that conform to SECTION M17.  T20.03  CONSTRUCTION METHODS.  Cleaning Pavement.  Ensure that all dirty pavements are swept or air blasted clean.  Remove and dispose of the piles of dirt obtained by sweeping.  Remove oil, grease, and similar adherent matter by washing with a suitable solvent.  Wipe excess solvent from the pavement, and allow the solvent to evaporate before applying pavement marking material.  Ensure  that  the  pavement  surface  has  been  cleaned  and  inspected  according  to  the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations before applying the markings.  Defective Work.  Obliterate  any  unsatisfactory  markings  resulting  from  the  presence  of  dirt,  oil,  grease,  scale, moisture, or other foreign substances and all other traffic markings rejected by the Engineer by a method approved by the Engineer and replace at no additional cost to the Department.  Temporary Pavement Markings.  a.  Condition  in  Container.    Ensure  that  the  paint  as  received  shows  no  livering,  skinning, mold  growth,  corrosion  of  the  container,  or  hard  settling  of  the  pigment.    Disperse  any settling when stirred by hand with no persistent foaming.  b.  Packaging.  Ensure that containers are either rust resistant (e.g., stainless steel or coated with a good quality epoxy or phenoxy clear coating) 30-gal open-head drums with drum lever lock, or ring and bolts, with rust resistant cover; or 250-gal rust-resistant moveable totes.  Ensure that drums are tight-filled and have a floating polyethylene lid liner in contact with the paint surface.  Use containers and lids that are white or off-white on the outside to avoid excessive heat build-up when sitting in sunlight.  Seal  the  field  samples  tightly  immediately  upon  sampling  and  submit  to  the  Materials Testing Laboratory within 72 hours for laboratory testing.  c.  Installation.  Ensure that the paint is reflectorized for night visibility by adding glass beads before the paint dries or sets by using drop-on or pressurized methods.  Ensure that the glass beads are evenly dispersed on a wet paint film of 14 to 16 mils (110 to115 sq ft per gal) at a rate of 6 lb/gal.  Apply  the  lines  with  airless  or  air-assisted  spray  equipment  so  that  the  paint  is  at  a temperature of 150\u00b0F maximum in the heat exchanger and between 120\u00b0 and 140\u00b0F at  SECTION T20  \u2014 PAVEMENT MARKINGS  T-65        Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  the spray nozzle.  Ensure that the maximum no-tracking time is not exceeded when the pavement temperature  is  greater  than  45\u00b0F  under  humidity  conditions  of  85  percent  or less on dry pavement.  Apply paint according to Subsection T20.03.5(a).  d. Acceptance.  Ensure that the markings conform to the greater of the applicable minimum retroreflectivity requirements of that pavement marking material or 50 mcd/m and that the markings maintain the minimum retroreflectivity of 50 mcd/m for the entire duration of their intended  use.    Replace  the  markings  at  no  additional  cost  to  the  Department  if  the retroreflectivity falls below the 50 mcd/m level.  Temporary Waterborne Pavement Markings.  Schedule temporary pavement markings such that they are placed on newly paved roadways, which shall be opened to traffic at the completion of each day\u2019s paving operations.  Thermoplastic Pavement Markings.  When  thermoplastic  pavement  markings  are  specified,  use  material  that  is  a  thermoplastic compound, free of volatiles, which is designed for machine application from approved equipment and readily extrudes at temperatures between 400\u00b0F to 425\u00b0F to produce a cross section of line \u215b-in. to  3/16-in. thick.  After cooling  to the  ambient  temperature  and  without  polymerization  or other chemical change, ensure that the line forms a pavement marking continuous and uniform in shape, having a clear and sharp dimension and of the quality and appearance specified.  Use material  that  is  especially  compounded  for  traffic  marking  and  does  not  lose  its  bond  with  the pavement when the ambient temperature falls below 32\u00b0F.  Ensure  that  the  reflectorization  is  obtained  from  approved  glass  beads  conforming  to Subsection M17.01.  Apply additional glass beads by the drop-on method at the rate of 0.08 lb/sq ft of marking.  Use  pigmented  binder  that  is  well  dispersed  and  free  from  all  skins,  dirt,  foreign  objects,  or ingredients that will cause bleeding, staining, or discoloration due to dissolution of asphalt in the pavement.  After application and drying time, ensure that the material shows no appreciable deformation or discoloration under local traffic conditions and in air and road temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0F to 120\u00b0F and that adheres securely under repeated freezing and thawing.  Maintain the stripes in the original dimensions and placement.  Ensure that the exposed surface are free from tack.  Ensure that the cold ductility of the material permits normal movement with the road surface without chipping or cracking to prevent dimensional distortion as a result of traffic impact within the temperature range specified.  Ensure that the ability to resist distortion by natural discoloration is retained for the life of the stripe.  Ensure that the compound does not deteriorate by contact with sodium chloride, calcium chloride or mild acids, alkalies, or other chemicals used against the formation of ice on roadways; by oil contained in the pavement material; or by oil drippings from vehicular traffic.  T-66  SECTION T20  \u2014 PAVEMENT MARKINGS  Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  When installed at an air temperature of 70\u00b0F, between \u215b-in. and 3/16-in. thick, ensure that the composition is completely solid and shows no effect of tracking after 15 minutes.  Provide  equipment  to  ensure  removal  of  dust,  debris,  and  other  foreign  matter  from  the  road surface immediately before the installation of the pavement marking.  Thermoplastic applicating equipment will be approved by the Engineer before the start of work.  For  heating  the  thermoplastic  composition,  ensure  that  the  application  equipment  includes  a melting kettle(s) of such capacity as to allow for continuous marking operations.  a.  Weather Conditions.  Place thermoplastic pavement markings on dry pavement surfaces. At the time of installation, ensure that the pavement surface temperature is a minimum of 50\u00b0F and rising.  As an option, if the surface temperature is 45\u00b0F and rising, the Contractor may choose to apply thermoplastic pavement marking material provided that the surface is dry and the Contractor accepts all responsibility for the performance of the thermoplastic line striping for a period of one year from the date of application.  Submit the request in writing to the Engineer for approval.  Replace any thermoplastic material that fails for any reason during the one-year period at no additional cost to the Department.  No  payment  will  be  made  for  that  quantity  of  material  placed  at  surface  temperatures below 50\u00b0F for the period of one year.  Epoxy Resin Pavement Markings.  a.  General.  Before any pavement marking work is initiated, submit a schedule of operations for the approval of the Engineer.  At least five days before starting striping, provide the Engineer  with  the  epoxy  manufacturer\u2019s  written  instructions  for  use,  including  material mixing ratios and application temperatures.  When pavement markings are applied under traffic flow conditions, provide all necessary signs,  cones,  arrow  boards,  etc.,  according  to  the  Contract  and  the  currently  adopted edition of the MUTCD to maintain and protect the traffic, the marking operation, and the pavement markings until thoroughly set.  b.  Application.    Perform  the  application  of  pavement  markings  in  the  general  direction  of  traffic.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  place  epoxy  lane  and  center  lines  within  the  guidelines  and restrictions of the Contract, and no previous lines exist, place the appropriate color of 4- in.  reflective  temporary  pavement  markings  for  the  entire  length  of  the  roadway  that  is unstriped according to the currently adopted edition of the MUTCD at no additional cost to the Department.  The type of temporary markings will be approved by the Engineer.  Remove, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, all tracking marks, spilled epoxy, and epoxy markings applied in unauthorized areas.  SECTION T20  \u2014 PAVEMENT MARKINGS  T-67      Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  c.  Test Strip and Calibration.  Before the start of striping operations, construct one or more test strips.  Ensure that each test strip includes approximately 100 linear feet of pavement with white and yellow striping (lane and edgeline) similar to that required for the Project. The  purpose  of the  test strip(s)  is to  demonstrate  the  capability  of  the  proposed  epoxy resin  striping  material,  and  the  equipment  and  procedures  to  place  epoxy  resin  traffic stripes  that  comply  with  these  Specifications  including  retroreflectivity,  dimensions, appearance (uniform color and crisp, well-defined edges), wet film thickness, drying time and  glass  bead  quantity,  application,  and  retention.    When  the  test  strips  are  in compliance, the Contractor will be permitted to proceed with the striping operations.  Use a test strip for each applicator unit used.  Additional test strips may be required when major  equipment  repairs  or  adjustments  are  made  or  at  any  time  requested  by  the Engineer.  d.  Procedures.  Clean the road surface to be free from all dirt, oil, grease, and other foreign material,  including  curing  compound  on  new  Portland  cement  concrete,  immediately before  the  striping  operation.    New  epoxy  markings  may  be  applied  over  worn,  well- bonded epoxy if approved by the Engineer; remove all others, such as thermoplastic, tape, and newly striped paint, as follows and as approved by the Engineer:  \u25cf  Grinding.  Remove markings to a minimum of 95 percent of their surface area.  Ensure that the method  does  not  damage  the  surface  in  any  way  and  has  no more than  a moderate  color  and/or  texture  change.    Ensure  that  the  grinding  truck  can  remove 80,000  linear  feet  of  6-in.  line  per  day.  and  is  equipped  with  a  vacuum  and  dust collector  that  is  99.99  percent  efficient  in  removing  particles  no  bigger  than  0.5 microns.  Replace any pavement markings removed within one day.  Removal is at no extra cost to the Department.  Use a sweeper with the capacity to pick up grindings simultaneously  with  the  removal  operation.    If  the  Contract  eliminates  grinding  of material, use power washing.  \u25cf  Power  Wash.    Remove  all  special  patterns,  handwork,  and  oil  or  other  deleterious substances by a power wash machine with a pressure of 2400 to 2800 psi with the water heated to 180 to 195\u00b0F.  Do not add chemicals to the water in the process.  Equip the machine with a turbo blast tip with oscillating head that can supply 5 gal/min/gun.  \u25cf  Cleaning.  Ensure that pavement cleaning includes at least a brushing with a rotary, non-metallic  broom  and  additionally  as  may  be  recommended  by  the  material manufacturer,  all  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Engineer.    Clean  new  Portland  cement concrete by sandblasting to remove any surface treatments and/or laitance.  Perform surface  cleaning  and  preparation  work  only  in  the  area  of  the  epoxy  markings applications.  Air-blast the pavement surface to remove dirt and residues just before the application of the markings.  \u25cf  Restrictions.    Apply  epoxy  striping  material  to  substantially  dry  pavement  surfaces. Ensure  that  the  pavement  surface  temperature  and  the  ambient  temperature  are  a minimum of 35\u00b0F at time of application.  Do not initiate or continue operations during periods of rain or in the case of damp pavement.  Cease operations until the Engineer determines that the roadway surface is dry enough to achieve adhesion.  T-68  SECTION T20  \u2014 PAVEMENT MARKINGS     Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  \u25cf  Heating.  Heat the individual epoxy components to the temperatures recommended in the  epoxy  manufacturer\u2019s  written  instructions  for  use  or  as  stated  in  the  FHWA Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects (note the maximum temperature of 140\u00b0F).  \u25cf  Ratio.    Monitor  the  ratio  of  the  two  components  during  the  application,  using  the installed  metering  devices.    If  the  ratio  falls  outside  the  range  of  \u00b15  percent  of  the manufacturer\u2019s specified mixing ratio for over 30 seconds or at any time falls outside of  the  range  of  \u00b110  percent,  stop  the  application,  and  determine  the  cause  of  the problem and correct before proceeding.  e.  Application.  Ensure that epoxy pavement markings are reflectorized for night visibility by adding reflective spheres before the paint dries or sets by the double-drop method.  Evenly disperse the reflective spheres, Type I followed immediately by Type II, on a minimum wet film thickness of 20 mils on existing and new pavements at a minimum rate of 12 lb/gal for each type of glass sphere.  Ensure that all special patterns and handwork (e.g., stop bars, arrows, legends, symbols) meet the above application rates with the following exception: For the double-drop application of glass spheres, use the Type II gradation only with two applications at a minimum of 12 lb/gal each.  Place the necessary spotting at appropriate points to provide horizontal control for striping and  to  determine  necessary  starting  and  stopping  points.    Use  longitudinal  joints, pavement edges, and existing markings to serve as horizontal control when approved by the Engineer.  Do not initiate marking operations until the applicable surface preparation work has been completed  according  to  the  manufacturer\u2019s  recommendations.    The  temperature  of  the mixed  epoxy  may  be  adjusted  as  required  for  prevailing  conditions,  including  air temperature and pavement temperature to achieve the prescribed no-track time.  Do not allow  the  speed  of  the  applicator  truck  to  exceed  the  recommended  rate  for  the combination of the truck rate, pressure in the lines, and the tip opening and height of the spray gun to ensure the required thickness.  f.  Quality Control.  A tolerance of \u00bc in. under or over the specified width will be allowed for striping  if  the  variation  is  gradual  and  does  not  detract  from  the  general  appearance. Ensure that alignment deviations for the control guide do not exceed 2 in. if the variation is gradual and does not detract from the general appearance.  Do not apply material over a longitudinal joint.  Establishment of these tolerances shall not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to comply as closely as practical with the planned dimensions.  g.  Retroreflection  Measurement.    Measure  retroreflection  using  a  30-meter  geometry  unit following ASTM D6359 with the following exceptions:  Ensure that the minimum values are not less than 350 mcd/lum/m2 for white and 225 mcd/lum/m2 for yellow as measured by the Engineer and that the measurement for acceptance is performed between 14 and 60 days after placement.  h.  Defective  Markings.    Repair  any  epoxy  reflectorized  pavement  markings  that,  after application  and  curing,  are  determined  by  the  Engineer  to  be  defective  and  not  in conformance with this Specification.  Perform the repairs to the satisfaction of the Engineer  SECTION T20  \u2014 PAVEMENT MARKINGS  T-69     Part T \u2014 Traffic Control Systems  December 2022  at no additional cost to the Department.  Detail the repair methods and submit for approval to the Engineer before corrective action.  Symbols and Word Messages.
